2,rowenta dz9080 advancer iron,"Never thought I'd spend over $100 for an iron, but I do a lot of sewing and this was a great investment. The micro steam vents give it great output and it evens steams great held in the vertical position. Highly recommend it though the price is above the lower end irons, but if you want a true performer, this is it."
1,Not sure,"I bought this because I have rosacea. It seemed to make it a little worse. My daughter put it on and her face broke out requiring steroid cream but I'm not sure if it was from that or she had an allergic reaction to a food. Either way, I'm hesistant to continue use of it."
2,Same as Always,"same product I've always used; however, I was hoping to find a better price, but no luck even on this site"
1,Not so good,"Neutrogena products are (usually) good, but this is not one of those. Ironically it does exactly what it says it doesn't. Even though it's oil-free it leaves greasy feeling on the skin and it makes the skin very shiny. It also caused breakouts on my skin. I give it 2 stars because, despite making your skin quite messy, at the end of the day - it does moisturize."
1,too shallow,i spend some time to read the book. the book is too simple.I don't get valuable knowledge from it. Maybe it is suitable for the guys who have few experience in IT company. It will waste your time to peruse the book if you have some experience in software company. I'm rather disappoint at the book. I don't understand why AMAZON top the book in the product management list.
1,Not worth the money,"I just bought this book recently. This book talks about many general concepts, but I didn't see many useful points."
1,Bad Grammar,"I am continually amazed by how many children's books contain incorrect grammar. At this age, children are rapidly developing language skills, and they do so by repeating what they hear. In this book, the authors write: ""Thomas goes slow. Slow slow slow he goes"". Do writers not understand the difference between adverbs and adjectives? Or do these publishers hire incompetent writers for children? Why would anyone want to teach their children to speak English incorrectly? If you want high quality Thomas literature, I would recommend the books that are closer to the original versions by the Awdrys, rather than bastardized, badly written books ""based on"" the original."
2,The Collected Uncollected,"This CD is a great time and money saver for B.B. King fans, collecting his numerous guest appearances from the last 20 years. Selections range from ""T'Ain't Nobody's Bizness (If I Do)"" from 1983's The King of Comedy OST to his appearances on several 2000 albums. More importantly, the CD stands on it's own as a very enjoyable B.B. album. Since the tracks come from a variety of sources, it showcases King's proficiency in several idioms, from Blues with Albert Collins, to Jazz with Grover Washington, Jr. and Gary Burton, to a duet with Willie Nelson on B.B.'s classic ""The Thrill Is Gone."" Also included is the previously unreleased ""Yes Man"" and unreleased in U.S. ""All You Ever Give Me Is The Blues."" Prime B.B. throughout."
2,Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"This book is excellent if you love the show on the WB. She is the person we all would want to be. I love this book and would recommend this book to anyone, young or old. It's just a great book!"
2,Love the lid.,"Wont repeat the GREAT things about this pot. I have 2. The lid fits on most pots. Handy with soups and homemade sauces. You can plop this lid on any pot for a snug, heavy fit."
2,Calphalon Stock Pot,"Very good price for stockpot this size with cover. Could be a littel thicker on bottom, but otherwise excellent. Material is easy to clean and much lighter than stainless steel or even some aluminum pots I have used."
2,"A great pot for large quantities, but a commitment","I would +1 all the positives from everyone else who reviewed this pot.For stove-top soup and sauce making, in large quantities. It is easy to clean, even though it doesn't have a ""non-stick"" coating, and the lack of such coating is why it has lasted this long.In reviewing my Amazon orders so I could review this, I see that I've owned most of my hard-anodized Calphalon for ten years. At the same time, I purchased a whole set of T-Fal cookware, which didn't perform as well and also didn't last--all those pieces are gone--evidence that buying quality cookware is a no-brainer.My one caveat is that you must figure out where you're going to keep it and where you're going to clean it before purchasing. Mine ""lives"" on top of my cabinets because it doesn't fit in them, and must be washed in the bathtub because it doesn't fit in the kitchen sink."
2,Love Calphalon,"Though I have yet to use this stockpot, I did purchase it at a good price and had always wanted this size. I have had and purchased Calphalon for many years and I can say that there is a marked difference in the product from the pans that I bought years ago, so I do wonder about the quality. Hard Anodized if used correctly can be one of the best metals to use in cooking. Read the directions and follow them and you will love this as much as I do. This is my most recent purchase so all my other Calphalon is much older and still in great condition. If this product doesn't hold up in the same fashion I will update this review, but as of now I'm a Calphalon FAN!! Thanks Amazon for the grat prices. PS the best time to buy the Calphalon is on their Friday sale day!"
2,pot for canning,"I bought this pot for canning (I make my own salsa - up to 100 qts) as I got tired of using my 6 & 8 qt pots at the same time. I've got over 30 calphalon pots/pans and although I prefer the quality of their products when they were made in Toledo, Ohio (several years ago), this is of similar quality of their ""made in china line""."
2,Calphalon,"This is a great pot. Nice and big, I love the size and the weight of it. The price at Amazon was great too. Love the Commercial line from Calphalon."
2,Nice but consider the 5-star rated Cuisinart Chef's Classic.,"It is currently selling for $25 less (varies) and is just a gorgeous, heavyweight pot that will challenge any Calphalon cookwear except perhaps the Tri-Ply line."
1,Not traditional Calphalon quality - FAR from it!,"After reading handfuls of horrible reviews, I decided to gamble on the stockpot anyhow. No deal. The product that I received was terribly sub-par. I could have put the lid on a record player and received a tune for my efforts... the entire pot was corrugated, grooved and uneven, and had a 'wrong' feel to the metal composition. I called Calphalon to exchange it - which they were happy to do for a 'contemporary' version of the same product. It turns out that ""Commercial Hard Anodized"" is no longer a line that Calphalon produces - so your chance of getting one that is the original quality is pretty much zilch unless you've actually handled the product that you plan to purchase. Go for a different make or model instead."
2,This little book is a MUST!,Kenneth E. Hagin's teachings are extremely helpful in learning how to walk by faith and how to have a better understanding of the word of God. He makes it all so simple!!! This is a MUST for anyone serious about the Lord.
2,Awesome,This was truly.just an awesome book written by brother haginYour words a truly important. I highly recommended it. Awesome
1,Only the cars shine in this movie!!,I saw this movie today and I thought what a thin plot. A guy just trying to get home to see his wife deliver. Kinda thin but hey I watched it anyway. The acting was so so but the best acting was by the radio guy Jason Priestly if that says anything. The car chases are really the only thing that keeps you interested in this movie if you're a Mopar fan. Still for the price they want for this movie I could find 5 other car chase movies that are all better. I'm glad I was one of the ones paying this outrageous price or I might have committed suicide.
2,A Great Film,"This is a fantastic film, especially if you enjoy car chasing scenes, burnouts and the like. The old Challenger is supercharged in the story and is supposedly VERY fast. Makes for some great action. Highly recommended. I will be buying this DVD."
1,second time trying to leave a rating,this is the second time I try to leave a review and am now wondering if this review stuff is BS
2,Review of Dennis Sandole's Guitar Lore,This book is fantastic. It covers many guitar lesson topics for all levels from the beginner to the advanced student.
2,"Good, but not very sturdy","This is a fun game, but to play at the more challenging levels you have to build some machines (like a scale, race car, ramp)that are used over and over in the game. Unfortunately, the materials provided are not very sturdy. The dowels were too big to fit into some of the required pieces and consequently,my husband broke one of the dowels trying to force it into the discs necessary to build the scale. Then we couldn't use the scale, which was really disappointing because it is central to the game. Also, my ten year old found an error in one of the question cards - the answer provided was incorrect. Having said all that, we still enjoy the game and play it alot even though we can't use the scale. It is very interesting, especially if your child has an inclination towards logic, mechanics, or physical sciences. My son loves it, and because he is mechanical minded (and I'm not!), he gets a kick out of getting answers right that Mom gets wrong!"
2,A fantastic board game!,This game really gets us all thinking--and learning. It's great for the aspiring engineer in your family.
2,Vikings,"In this pack there is a chance to get viking ships. Be carefull when inserting the tabs on the masts, occasionaly they will break. This is an amazing product. I ordered one of these and got not only the ship you see in the picture, but an icebreaker as well. Getting an icebreaker is rare, and to sum it all up, this is a great addition to anyone's fleet."
2,Sounds even better than its gorgeous and solid construction,"SONY ES line is built to correct the common misconception that SONY cannot build quality audiophile product. You really need to audition it at a local high-end HiFi store to appreciate the precise and accurate sound reproduction. It is built solid like a tank - nearly 55 pounds. I wish I had as I'd never paid for my DENON, YAMAHA, and Pioneer units. If you find a good used unit - buy it. The no fuss, clean, and minimalist appearance blends nicely with any modern setup. Do not be tempted with a low priced DA 3000ES unit. The DA 3100ES unit has a far superior sound output."
2,Great pedal for the price,"This a great pedal for the price, I ride mountain bikes every weekend and this pedal stands up to the best of them. awesome purchase for half the price of real bear trap pedals."
1,A disappointing purchase of an excellent movie,"The film came in good time but it was an obviously pirated copy which had been made to look like a rental unit. The vendor likely purchased it in a lot and likely also didn't know that the copy was pirated. The cover of the case was well done but obviously faked. A search for the video rental store brought no result and it likely never existed. It played fine with a couple of dropouts due to it being a copy.I love this movie. I first saw it on the big screen in 1979 and was impressed by the storyline. The sex scene was a big deal at the time but tame by some of today's standards.It was released on a limited basis on VHS but never saw a release on any other media. Thus, original copies command prices in the $120 range. Finding a copy at less than $30 was a find that became a disappointment once the fact that it was a copy was ascertained."
1,Might be okay if you buy it soon enough,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side. The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product. If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time. I guess by that point nothing would have helped. It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though."
2,"Helpful, but not a miracle","The Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge has given me an hour or two of extra sleep when I feel the need to use it. I didn't really think it was going to work very well, but it provides a nice support system for your back and belly while sleeping on your side. The only problem I have with it is not being able to reposition myself easily or get out of bed easily when I am using it. So I usually end up throwing it onto the floor midway through the night so I can move around better.Even so, I would recommend this product because it has helped me get into a very comfortable position to fall asleep in... and I am getting up to go to the bathroom several times a night anyway, so it's not like removing the wedge is causing a sleep disturbance."
2,good book,its a great book and i enjoyed it as a little slow in some parts but other than that i really enjoyed it
1,"Easy read, simplistic and predictable","I enjoyed the ride in this less than a days read, but will not recommend it to any of my friends or family. Very predictable in the plot, the elephant revenge, the pregnancy and everything else. Boo"
2,Recommendation: YES,"Totally different from your everyday read. At first, your wondering where is the author going with this, but yet she keeps you captivated. As you continue reading it gets better and better. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry. It has all the ingredients of being a best-seller. Highly recommended."
2,Surprisingly entertaining,I was skeptical of a book detailing life in a traveling circus. But overall this was an entertaining and well written book. There were a few things that didn't flow well or weren't really explained (or at least I didn't understand them) like why Jacob was so outraged at the gentleman who said he had worked at the circus or for what reason Marlena was throwing a suprise for her husband (that ended up going poorly). But these uncertainties didn't stop me from enjoying the story. Surprising twist. Sweet ending.
2,Water For Elephants,"I found the book very intesting. Not at all what I expected. The insite of an aging person, I found to be a really interesting effect, along with the excitment & the hard life of Circus life. As I was reading the book I thought this would really make a good movie. I heard yesterday that it is being made into a movie. What a complement to Sara Gruen & her writing skills. Looking forward to reading more of her books.PJ"
1,I knew it,"My book club read and discussed this book a few years ago. All but one of us hated it. I knew then that it was written---or edited---for easy adaptation to film.Ta da!!The overall skeleton of the story is not bad, I just wish that another writer fleshed it out. This is minor literary fiction, at best."
2,A surprisingly great book,"I was a bit skeptical at first, but soldiered on, as the book was recommended by a friend who truly knows books. She was right! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story is just quirky enough to be satisfyingly fun, while the characters are so well drawn that we feel as though we have met them somewhere. I've recommended this book to numerous friends, and my copy is now circulating among them. Enjoy!"
1,Disappointed,I saw the movie and was so very excited to read the book. I was excited mainly because usually the book is better than the movie. In this case it is my opinion that the movie was better than the book.The first two and half chapters were good. Then language was used which was totally not needed. If that was not bad enough then we get to read a very detailed account of a stripper. This part was detailed way to much and left nothing to the imagination at this point I was so disappointed that I deleted the book from my Kindle and have choose not to complete the book.
2,Started off slow but it won't disappoint you.,"Like I said, at the beginning I hung in there. A really good book will have me page turning till the late hours of the night that wasn't the case at first. As I approached midway through the book I was up late reading and I began taking the book to work to sneak it a few chapters. The author did a great job of researching the matter you can tell from the vivid writing and dialogue. Great read."
1,Overrated,I heard this book was amazing. A must-read. It isnt. The plot is pretty good. I was drawn in by the writing and intrigued by the subject. But the relationships are not very believable and the ending was just ridiculous fluff. Don't waste your time unless you're REALLY hard up for something to read.
1,"Terrible, trite writing - how was this a bestseller?","I am increasingly concerned at the state of literature in this country, and this book reaffirmed that concern. How on earth was this so well-received? It had such poor, redundant writing. And for all the reviews about how ""accurate"" it was, the author seems to have forgotten in all her research that hitting someone's wife was quite the norm in the '30s and would not likely have inspired the [trite, redundant] outrage that her poorly-developed caricatured characters expressed.Definitely a mindless read, if that's what you're after."
1,It Ain't Literature,"It ain't literature, but it must substitute for what America no longer creates: Literature. Due to the critical acclaim, I gave it a shot and muscled through. The supporting cast is cookie cutter, the lead elephant his own Hannibal, and the mystery of the protagonist's middle-life revealed with a fizzle. Gruen's best writing reveals the realities of senior living. God knows every writer struggles to produce entertaining, memorable work, but perhaps you've already Red Boxed the movie and saved yourself a few bucks. And hours of eye strain."
2,water for elephants,excellent---sorry I waited so long to read it never saw the movie yet either!Guess I'm just late with everything
1,An edited version would have been nice,"It's apparent early that this book is well-written and I enjoyed the challenge it presented in vocabulary and complex characters. However, it is not for the modest and certainly I would never recommend it to a Christain or youg reader. It is obvious that the author had hollywood in mind becuase the descriptions of several events reach beyond crude. I would have liked it very much if the uglier parts of the story were implied instead of described down to the ""toenail"". Sadly, because of the vulgarity, I did not finish what I had hoped would be one of my favorite reads."
1,This is a Best-seller?,"As a piece of light beach-reading, this is competent. But it's also boring and flat, and the characters unbelievable. It's very hard to locate the conflict for the first half of the book, and the shifts from the mind of a 93-year old to that of 23-year old is gimmicky and not at all convincing."
2,Great!,"Loved the back and forth between past and present. It put you right in his shoes - you're right there in his younger days living the adventure of the circus and ""snap"", you're with him at the end of his years wondering whose withered body it is he's looking down at. I couldn't wait to jump back into the past, not just to see what would happen next, but also for the interesting era and relationships of the travelling circus. This book was a true escape into another time and place with it's detailed descriptions of the sights, sounds and even smells of what seemed like a grueling yet rewarding profession.Highly recommended!"
1,Disappointing....,The highly improbable plot and characters were a disappointment. This was not a fun book!
2,Amazing Read!,I can not put this book down. It is beautifully written have bought an extra one for my sister in law! Love it!!
2,First purchase and read on my kindle.,What a great story. This book really touches on the elderly in assisted care faculities. You really feel for the charecters. The circus comes to life with Rosie the elephant the beautiful marlena and uncle al. worth your time.
2,Very sweet,This was a beautiful book with a sweet ending. Definitely some beauty in the memories the main character reminisced on and the reader can get hooked.
1,Water foe elephants review,"This book began well, however, the language used and the graphic sexual descriptions were very unnecessary and due to the severity of both, I quit reading the book after the first several chapters."
1,crude,I was disappointed in this book after reading many reviews praising it. It was disgusting and poorly written. It had no redemption and the plot was poor.
2,"History, Action, Animals, Mystery, Love and Sex, its got it all!","I have seen this book on the shelves for sometime now and only just got around to reading it. It was so enjoyable that I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is intriguing without being over complicated. It is a peek into the history of the circus, all the while swirling a great mystery and love affair that will keep you glued to this page turner. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, mysteries, and a truly good read."
2,Water for Elephants; a Novel,Water for ElephantsI really enjoy this book. It's written well to keep your interest. I read the book in one day because I wanted to know what happened next. Well done!
2,Loved it!,"Entertaining and thought provoking. I have never attended a circus, nor have my now adult children because of the cruelty to animals aspect of this form of entertainment. This book is an accurate depiction of the life of circus animals and performers. I will read this author's work again! Highly recommend!"
1,another doomed affair book,"I thought this book was poorly developed and depressing. Really, can anybody come up with a book that doesn't involve infidelity? This guy threw away his whole life and what was the point of this book? I thought it stunk. I can't even believe I read this tripe. stay away from this author..."
1,fun story ruined with pointless side topics,"I had heard good things about this book. I was ready for a good light read and was intrigued with the beginning, but surprised by the constant obsession with sex. The author could not continue the story line without throwing in a useless and pointless portion about sex. To me that really took away from the story and ruined it for me. By the end of the book I was disappointed and didn't like the end at all. If you want a light engaging story, I'd skip this book. If you're looking for something other than a Harlequin Romance Novel, but with that type of subject then feel free to read this. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Excellent,Very enjoyable read. I wish the ending included his family! I really began to sympathize with the elderly man in this story.
1,Animal Abuse,I managed to read half the book and then couldn't handle reading any more animal abuse. It was the worst I have ever read before. I should have known since it was written about a circus not to read it.
2,Some circus ride!,"This was a very romantic and sweet book. In the beginning I found Jacob to be very real; moving and sympathetic. Ahh, but then the circus comes to town and we're back to his youth ...The travails of working in a traveling circus are real and riveting; the details seem accurate. At times I thought the author lost her voice but for the vast majority of this book, I enjoyed it a great deal!"
2,Touching and Romantic...a Great Book!,"I honestly just picked this book up b/c i kept seeing it places and figured i would try it. It was a really great book and i have recommended it to almost everyone. Not only is the storyline entertaining, touching, and romantic (without being too girly and sappy)...but the author does an amazing job of building the characters. I was disappointed when the book was done because i wanted to keep reading."
1,total let down,got the sample for my kindle and loved it. bought it. then it got raunchy. alot of bad language and vulgar descriptions. I just wish all that had been in the sample so I wouldn't have wasted my money buying the book!
2,Cute & Compelling,"Well-written, colorful characters, fun read. The authorised a great job of painting a vivid picture and making me feel like I was right there with the circus crew."
1,not for me,UGH! The first couple chapters were wonderful. Then it went downhill so fast I thought I was reading another book. don't waste your money.
2,Great book,"This is such a good book, i finished it and read it through a second time immediately. I wasn't ready to put it down. Wonderfully intertwined stories written with great skill and insightful finesse. The movie could never hold a candle to the elegance of the written version"
2,Love the rich details!,"Water for Elephants takes you to the time of the Great Depression on a circus train. I was hesitating on reading this story because I thought it would be heartbreaking. It's hard for me to read about animal cruelty and reading about a circus there is bound to be some ugly scenes. There are some scenes that were hard to read, but for the most part I felt the author did spare us the raw details. Sara Gruen knows how to write rich details in such a way that the circus jumped off the pages. I felt like I was there surround by the sounds and smells of the circus. I loved the characters and Rosie the elephant was the show stopper. It was a pleasure reading this story and a huge plus for me that it had a happy ending."
2,Just amazing!,It didn't take me very long to finish this book after I started! It has a love story that pulls on the strings of your heart leaving you wanting more.. Such a great read!
1,I don't get it...,I was looking forward to reading this book but I was disappointed. The foul language and incredibly graphic sex scenes were appalling to me. The only part I liked was the flash backs to the old man.
1,Don't do it,"This is one of the worst books I've read. It has a lot of attention grabbing fodder but no backbone. I did read all the way though, only to find out how it ended. If you like sensationalized nonsense, here's your book!"
1,don't recommend it,"boring! can't understand why so many people enjoyed reading this book, I read 1/3 of it, and just couldn't make myself to read any longer."
1,Interesting? Maybe? Maybe not.,"If you like adventure, romance, suspense, and excitement... read the last third of Water for Elephants. The first two-thirds set the stage for a thrilling ending, but that's all. Although Gruen's style of writing is rich with varied vocabulary and description, the elements of the first part of the plot evoke little to no emotion in the reader. Even if the author didn't spend a hundred pages building the back-story, the strange sexual elements that rear their ugly faces every few pages completely ruin the enjoyment of reading this book. If you want to spend 300 pages wondering why you're reading this story, then pick up Water for Elephants and enjoy the most boring story you have ever read."
1,tedious,"Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die. That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more."
2,Best book I have read all year!,"This is the best book I have read all year. I did not want this story to end. If you only read one book this year, this should be it!"
2,"Interesting story, beautifully written","This beautifully written novel opens with Jacob, age 93 or 90 - he doesn't remember which. The book flashes back and forth from Jacob's present life in an old-age home to his young adult life caring for animals in a traveling circus. Though a bit over the top, this story is so marvelously told that I found myself turning page after page savoring the prose."
2,Loved it,"The more I read, the more fascinated I got. All of the intricate details Jerome picking up the book and flipping the pages."
2,Thank you Sara!,"the novel had substance, you know, a plot. Unpredictable. Just when you think you might know what's going to happen next. Intrique. Sadness, hardship, joy. Keeps you hoping things will work out -- of course, cannot tell whether they do or not -- a good, good read."
2,Great read,This book was such a great love story with a very different backdrop. I loved learning about the circus life.
2,great book!,"Water for elephants is a great book! i wasn't so sure at the beginning, but I'm glad i stuck with it. definitely recommend to readers looking for a thriller."
1,Really?,"I endured this inartful, trite novel from beginning to end and I'm baffled by its popularity. Even as a peek into a fringe society it lacks any surprises. Frustratingly boring."
2,nice,I read this book thinking it was going to be boring and dry and was pleasantly surprised that it contained a very thought out and poigniant love story. The author was able to paint vivid descriptives and the traveling circus was a fun element that added a bold dash of life in the story line. I would love to read more from this author.
2,Water for Elephants,It was a very enjoyable book. It was written well and easy to understand. I would read another book like this again.
1,Definitely did not love it,"This book was easy reading, but was also kind of facile and read like a treatment for a movie script (and I am sure there will be a movie). I think we were supposed to find crotchety old Jacob lovably cantankerous, but I just thought he was annoying. The circus story (featuring young Jacob) was much better, but all it has is plot--characters don't really develop, writing is passable but not skilled."
2,Great book,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It was a delight to read on several levels: aging, circus life, and life during the depression. I loved the characters and the plot."
2,solid 4 out of 5,"I read this book in one day. Not necessarily because it was a ""can't put it down page-turner"", but more because I had a Sunday with nothing else to do. I am always a fan of well-researched work, and Gruen has definitely done her work here. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of details in character development and/or setting, but that's just a personal preference. I have read some other reviews that say the book was drawn out and too lengthy, but I disagree. I feel that it moved rather well and flowed. My biggest problem with the book was the last chapter. It seemed to be a bit too fanciful and didn't really match the tone of the rest of the book. Still definitely worth reading though."
2,A lyrical masterpiece,"As avid readers there are times when we are apt to encounter books that continue and linger in our minds once read. For me, ""Water for Elephants"" was a serendipitous find and I truly and lovingly enjoyed this novel. It's one of those books that you never want to end. There is reason why this book has been on the NY Times bestseller list for more than 12 consecutive weeks. As many reviewers have already recounted the summary I will simply say just READ IT! I promise you will be searching for more of Sara Gruen's novels. BTW, Apehouse is the next novel to be released!"
1,pointless,I was really disappointed by this book. The only parts that were not too bad were the chapters where Jacob was an old man. But the circus stuff was very pedestrian. No spark to the writing. Don't waste your time.
2,LOVED THE BOOK ENDED TOO SOON.,"it transported you to a time and place you might not ever experience in our lifetime. IT was an easy read, very enjoyable."
2,Loved it.,"The Carnival life isn't easy. Being chucked off the rails, the mistreatment of animals. This story though, brings the Carnival life to life. The ending was beautiful. So masterfully done. The book was so much better than the movie. If you have not seen the movie (which by now I am sure you have), read the book, you feel each and every character like it were you."
1,Boring and hard to get through the first 200 pages,"I bought this book based on the recommendations from amazon. I found the book difficult to get through until the last 100 pages. The story is slow and simply tedious. I had to force myself through it. The end of the story, about 200-250 pages in, it picks up a bit and becomes more fast paced and readable."
2,Better than I expected for a book about a circus,"Frankly, I hate the circus, which I forgot when I downloaded this book. But I gave it a shot and quickly got over my circus thing. While it is set in a traveling circus, there is enough drama to carry you. I really liked the way we got to know the characters. The author did an excellent job weaving their development with the unfolding plot. I recommend it. It wasn't the best book I've ever read and won't watch the movie, but read it."
2,One of the best well written books I've read in a long time...,"Water for Elephants took me by surprise. This book was really well-written. Not only does this author know how to tell a story, she educates the reader without making it unreadable. She seamlessly wove the main characters story around the unknown story of circus life during 1930s. She offers a glimpse of animal treatment, different types of jobs within and the classes that separate the workers, the expectations given by towns on entertainment, prohibition, etc. The research is evident and I welcomed and looked forward to it. The book does have romance but it has so much more depth so I read freely, not really anticipating the story between the hero and the heroine.Sara Gruen has made me a fan and has given me hope for modern writers."
2,Water for Elephants- A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book as evidenced by the fact that it only took me a few days to read. The characters are engrossing and realistic. It is amazing that Sara was able to write the part of an old man with such realism. When I read a book, I also like to learn well researched real facts. This book did not disappoint in that area. The history is interesting and accurate. The end of the book is satisfying. If you would like to ""get lost"" in a great book, this is a good choice."
2,SO worth it!,"Warning: Do not pick this book up unless you have plenty of time on your hands! Once you pick it up, you won't want to put it back down! I didn't want it to end. Excellent read!"
1,Inappropriate language,"There was a lot of sexual language that didn't add to the story at all. I enjoyed the movie and the story followed the movie well, it just had a lot more sexual content than I want to read."
1,didn't like it,I didn't like the story line and the lanuguage and sexual content. It was much too graphic for me. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone
1,Not so great :(,"I bought this book around the time the movie came out, and I still haven't finished it. I've never seen the movie, and only bought this book because it had good reviews on Amazon. However this book turned out to be quite a disappointment.Pros:- interesting subjectCons:- Awful cliched characters- No character development- story told in very umimspired mannerI don't understand why people like this book. Its slow and pulpy."
1,Profanity and Sex Scenes,I purchased this because I read good reviews and it was only $4 on Kindle. It is full of sex scenes and profanity. Very sorry I purchased it. Will stay with Christian fiction.
1,"Not convincing, dull protagonist",The protagonist is not convincingly portrayed. He impresses as a bit dull. Somehow he acted without characteristics that justify his actions.
2,Water for elephants,"I feel in love with the characters in this book and enjoyed each of their adventures, trials and tribulations. I will remember this story for years to come."
1,Drivel,"-Juvenile and disney plot.-faulty and unrealistic details.-Uninteresting and underdeveloped characters.-Premature professions of love.Basically, this book reads like a typical Hollywood movie. This is unfortunate, but it is representative of a new class of novelists who are more influenced by movies' depiction of culture, rather than the actual culture itself. Minus all the R-rated stuff, this is nothing more than a whimsical book for adolescents. Once again an underwhelming and lazy manifestation of a great concept."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I give the author an ""A"" for research, but really this book was quite boring. I'm not sure why anyone would give this book 5 stars, unless they have an obsession for the circus. I just don't get it."
2,Very good read,"I thought this book started off a bit slow. It took a while to build up the characters and the story. But when the story does launch, you've become so attached to the characters that anything that happens is so tense and nail biting. It became a real page turner. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good heartfelt read."
2,Magical,"To me, the mark of a good book is when you don't want to see it end. And when it does end, you can't stop thinking about it. That's how this book was to me. The characters were so richly drawn that I actually felt like they could be real people. When some of the injustices happened I had to remind myself that this was fiction. Sara Gruen writes this amazing story against a backdrop of the Great Depression and that adds so much to the story. I can't say too much about it without giving away important plot points, but I did not see the big twist coming. I'm surprised I didn't, as all the signs were there, but I was just so engrossed in the story that I didn't put them together. This is a book I will read again and again."
1,Not for me..I was bored!,I was so bored that I couldn't finish this book. This was a book club book and some of friends loved it but not me. I just couldn't get into it. It's not as engaging as I thought it would be. I hope the movie is better.
1,Just do not see all the hype,"I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not ""stellar"" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes."
2,Surprising Twists and Turns - Well Researched,"I'm going to be careful here, because I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers. Let me just say it is a great book, sometimes disturbing, but often funny and charming, or filled with action. It also has a good bit of grit and tenacity in the main character. It is a look inside a unique community that you wouldn't get a chance to view this close if you weren't being ""escorted"" by one of their own. You may be tempted to stop reading at some point if you are an excessively tender soul, however hang in there. All you need to know for now is this, it is a fresh well-written book that you will love and ends in a good way so, have no fear of it and enjoy."
1,anti semititic,No sympathetic charactersI was angry About having spent a dime on this.Contributed to a sense that all good books already exist
1,Disappointment,"Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring."
2,Water For Elephants,"This book hooked me from the first page. I'm a student of history and I love any book that is accurate on its historical research. The story was memorizing and flowed nicely from beginning to end. I felt empathy with the main character all through the book. The real accomplishment is that I still think of the book, even though I finished reading it over a month ago. It's a story that is sticking with me, which is a rarity for me. Also, my colleagues and I travel a lot. This is one book that I feel free to loan. And if it doesn't make its way back to me, I hope every person who finds this book, reads it and hopefully, will carry the message of the book with them for a long long time. This book is a ""MUST READ""."
1,Missing something,"I bought this book when it first came out, because of the exceptional reviews I read. I have never finished this book. I started it, shelved it, read three books, went back to it and I just could not foster up enough interest to continue reading. The story line is uninteresting and the characters were dull. I finally accepted that I would not likely ever to read it; so I tried to sell the book back to the store. The book store did not accept it because this item was not moving from the shelves! It was definitely not worth the money I spent on this item."
2,This book was amazing!,"This was the first book I read on my new kindle fire, and I loved it so much. I had seen the movie and I thought it was good. But I always think the books are better. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
2,A pleasant read,"I would like to thank Ms. Gruen for writing such a pleasant tale . I knew a child who once ""ran away to join the circus"" and her life did not have as happy of an ending as did Marlena's. I thought of her often as Jacob's life unfolded and as Rosie saved them all."
2,fantastic book,"heard about this book from a friend and was unable to put it down! as a healthcare worker, the character of older jacob has insights all should be aware of and consider. vivid imagery and a fascinating plot. highly reccomended"
2,Good read,Did not see the movie the or hear anything about book subject matter. To my surprise was thoroughly engrossed in the story line . Great read loved it
1,water for elephants,"It is actually a waste of time and money! The plot could be very good, but filled with sensual and detailed pornographic material it could do without!"
1,very crude in some parts,I was hoping this was not like most modern day fiction when it came to crudeness... I will not be recommending it to my Christian friends...
1,Not Bad,I thought this book was a little slow. I wasn't really jazzed by it and thought the ending was weak.
2,This rube was hooked,"As an animal-lover and not a fan of the circus, I felt a little wary of the setting and subject matter when beginning to listen to the unabridged audio version of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. But soon I was totally hooked by the two narrators, young and old voices of Jacob, and by Gruen's evocative language and masterful storytelling. Like another reader/reviewer, I was reminded of family stories about the Depression--and of all we can go through and live through."
2,Must own this book!,"I absolutely loved this book! I enjoyed the history, the animals and of course Jacob and Marlena. I'm an animal lover and was heartbroken the way some were treated in the book, but, you must realize this can be reality. Trust me justice is served for the animal cruelty. I plan to pull this book out next year and re-read! It's a keeper."
1,Disappointing,"Although well-written, I found this novel disappointing. I would've liked to hear more about the circus and it reminded me far too much of The Notebook."
2,"Great book, great story","Sometimes it's just really nice to sit down with a good book, a really good book that is written by someone with talent. A feel good, pleasant read."
2,One of the Best Books I've Read in a Long Time,"Water for Elephants has it all- adventure, drama, romance, history, and the circus! What more can you ask? Seriously, read this book."
2,Very interesting,"I read this book about a year ago. I was a little unsure of the subject matter, however, the book pulled me in. I got very interested in the various characters, I found that it was one of my favorite books I read last year."
1,Ham Sandwich,"Easy going down and eminently forgettable. Not a bad effort by Ms. Gruen by any means, but a substantial amount of the book is given to cliched, obvious writing (both in language and character). The general premise is enjoyable, however; who doesn't like the circus? Reading ""Water for Elephants"" is like watching a movie on cable - odds are that you've already seen it, you know where it's going, but it's still a decent way to pass some time."
1,Not so great,"The item looks smaller in pictures than it really is. Definitely not for beginners in the rear, due to size. Also the vibe that came with it worked for about 20 seconds and quit. May have just gotten the one that missed quality control, but be careful since it's a non-returnable item."
1,Flimsy nail file,Very Disappointed because it bends easily and it tears up my nails---I am going to throw it out---I wouldn't recommend it.
1,disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. I did not find it encouraging at all.....as a matter of fact....I found it more pro for the stepkids and bio fathers. I was looking for a book that would allow me to feel okay that I don't feel certain ways as a stepmother and I was looking for encouraging words to make me feel that I did not have to have the pressure on me as a stepmother and to feel that I was not expected to do all the compromising. I did not find it helpful and I discarded the book.
1,Nice Little Toy,"Well, it's cute, but you don't want to jam or even practice with it.All I can say is, don't buy it for practice reasons. Maybe for a youngster that is 1st starting out, but then if he or she practices with this pedal, it may encourage not to play music. Yep, that's how bad it is.It is heavy duty except for the knobs. Yuk Yuk"
1,Dont buy from this store,Ok I have a high respect for amazon and its products but amazon as a company made a BIG mistake when they started carrying futons from the futon store. We recieved this futon with 2 missing pieces and at least 4 damaged beyond being usable. Then when I contacted the store to replace them it took them 2 weeks to even get back to me and another week to send me the WRONG pieces in a completely different finish then the futon I got. Also they refused to replace one of the pieces (a major weight bearing piece)so we had to contact a carpenter to refashion the piece. So basically you are paying a lot money for funature that is not useable untill you spend more money to fix their product. When I contacted the company again to ask for a refund on thier broken product they told me there was no refund and that they were not liable for the product. Please do not purchase this product it will not be worth your time or money
1,CUTE AS A JOKE,Poorly made ... wore less than 10 times ... already falling apart. More for a joke than actually practical slippers.
2,Former long term Nivea customer,"I too have been using this product for years. With so many of us using it, why would they stop making it? Just doesnt make sense to me. Come on, now you can buy it for $99.00 a jar. That is just insane. I will try other products, and I am sure I can find something I like just as well. But this time it will not be a Nivea product, because they obviously do not care about their customers."
2,Execellent Book,The book does an execellent job of explaining and showing how to use a difficult Pro/E module. The documentation from PTC is weak!! I highly recommend this book to all level users. It is hard to fine a good book. This is a good book.
2,interesting,"the book is interesting. it focuses on different times in adolescence and different experiments that have been done. all in all, it's a pretty good buy."
2,A great release by a great band,"I've gotten pretty into this band in the past year or so, and really love this album. The acoustic parts they do go great with the mood, and the heavy guitar riffs are just pure attitude. The only reason this didn't get five stars from me is because it kinda sounded to me like they just took a CD's worth of riffs and stuff and threw some lyrics over them, as opposed to some of the wonderfully orchestrated albums of their past. Don't get me wrong, it's a masterpiece in almost every sense of the word, and there are some songs on here that fit together just as well as any, like Theater of Pain. If you are a power metal fan at all, or just appreciat music with a melody, you won.t get tired of this album any time soon."
2,KR Volume 3 review,"I like the song list on this one. It has songs that I know and really like. I would have given this a 5, if I had not bought the KR Party. If it had the options like that one it would have definitely gotten a 5. But it is still very good game."
1,"Cute chair, but not very durable","We ordered this chair and the green frog chair for our boys' playroom. Now granted, we have two active boys, ages 2 and 8 at the time, but this Elephant chair lasted just over a month before it began to fall apart. Literally. The stitching started to come out, followed by the bars that held up the arms. It was completely unusable within two months. The frog, I should say, has held up wonderfully, so try a different animal."
1,overrated,"Basically, I was recommended this book since I am a big Star Trek fan and someone interested in religious theory. The title is catchy, but the book has several shortcomings.First, the arguments posed and the analysis conducted are the kind that any true Star Trek fan could conjure up just by watching the episodes. For examples used, the authors pick the most blatantly obvious episodes with which to work with (i.e. TNG's ""Who Watches the Watchers"")and throw loose theories together which are made quite apparent by simply watching the episode itself! In fact, throughout the book, no truly original theory is argued fully - here and there we catch bits and pieces from characters such as the Prophets, or Q, and how they are ""godlike"" - a point which the script writers obviously include.In addition to this, there are also several errors which any true fan would never fail to notice!Overall, save your money, and watch the shows and movies and judge for yourself."
1,Not for me; your mileage may vary!,"Due to budgetary constraints, I had to find a cheaper night cream. I'm 43 with combo, slightly sensitive skin that's blackhead-prone and subject to the occasional pimple. For the most part I only need night cream in the wintertime. This feels lovely going on (soothing, silky texture); it's non-irritating (to me) and unscented. However, whether I apply a lot or a little, I wake up with extremely greasy skin that still feels somewhat dry and parched underneath, and the blackheads are worse. I'm guessing that sesame oil doesn't agree with me. It's hit or miss with natural oils--my face loves avocado and almond oils but olive and soybean oils make me break out. Your mileage may vary!I will be using this up on my neck and decollete, where it works beautifully--lovely glow and no greasiness--though n.b., I detect a slight scent of sesame oil under my turtlenecks and recommend you don't apply this under silk and dry-cleanables."
1,Also had allergic reaction...,I used this cream at night and woke up with an allergic reaction (which is always possible with new creams). My whole face was swollen and red and I had a numbing/tingling feeling. I washed my face and by the afternoon it was mostly gone. Test a small area first!I'm usually allergic to mold...First time I've had an allergic reaction to any cream and I've used Neutrogena products before.
2,love it,This game is so fun. its even better when you unlock everything. if you want to add a game to your library this would be the one. deffently worth a buy.
1,Small containers,This is a true trial/demo product size. I am not sure why it is so expensive given the VERY small amount of product you actually get. I would not recommend this choice in the Burts Bees line.
2,Great product,This product gave protection to me and my wife during the cold winter season. Without this we would have suffered a lot. It has some pleasant smell
1,Not very well made,"Bought these for my son to wear during his municipal police academy physical training exercises. They lasted about 10 days before the sole began to separate from the boot. Apparently they are affixed only with some sort of adhesive. I attempted to reglue the sole to the boot, but the repair didn't last much longer than the original assembly. I cannot recommend these for serious use; they'd be good for a Halloween costume perhaps."
1,Were not all 5!!!,"This has got to be the most babyish game ive everplayed. I mean slime, foodfights, what is this??? You should buy this game from ages 5-10. Otherwise this is a big :("
2,What's best?,"This game's top notch spot are MINI-GAMES! The Skating B-Ball game is quite cool! The Inner Tube races I like the most, it just seems sooooooo cool!"
1,La peste,"Este tipo de musica no merece ser publicada, nunca te compres un disco de camela, es música para ginchos.ENGLISH: Press the ""back"" button of your browser and have a good day."
1,not worth the money,"I bought the basic version, and I regret it; definitely not worth the money: the vocabulary lists are meager, and that's all this really is: mostly very basic noun practice, with a few lists of common phrases thrown in. I suppose this would be worth shelling out for if you want to learn some names of animals, but if not, not. The pronunciation function is helpful in that it has a slow-speed version to help you hear all the sounds in a word, but still not worth the money, even if it's just three-starbucks-beverages worth. Pity. Transparent Language started as a rigorous drill program that included grammar forms, etc. This is just rather thin."
2,Fantastic pan but the bottom coating is coming off,"My husband and I love these pans and how they cook food. We follow the directions about preheating which is important and have never washed them in the dish washer and hand wash them thoroughly. BUT, the bottom covering is coming off and the silver is showing through and there are places on the bottom where there are black spots I cannot get clean despite all the hand washing. They wash up easily other than the spots on the bottom! I read in one of the reviews below about a special cleaner or bon ami so may try those. We have a whole set and have really enjoyed them a great deal despite the problems I""ve mentioned above."
1,WARNING: This product contains PARABENS and is a cancer risk!,"I work outdoors year round and have used this product for many years because it works wonders on cracked hands. A friend of mine noticed me using this hand cream and warned me that it contains PARABENS which have been linked to various types of cancer including breast cancer. I have since learned that Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream contains not just one but two different types of Parabens. I researched and found that PARABENS are a chemical that mimics estrogen. Furthermore, Parabens are found in many lotions and cosmetics as well as food products. Men who read up on Parabens will never go near them again because PARABENS can shrink testcles and damage male libido. I will never use this product again. In my opinion, this product should be banned. Don't take my word or anyone elses word for it, do your own research, become informed and then make your own judgement. I for one am done with this stuff."
2,Moisturizing,After putting this on I forget about my dry winter hands for hours. I just wish it came in a lager size and with a better cap.
1,moisturizing??,"I applied the cream correctly every time, and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin, BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product doesn't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is ""concentrated"" apparently but i need moisture!! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy, I'm guessing it's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something, but it's very unpleasant feeling. It smells like plastic even though it's fragrance free."
2,I received my package of Neutrogena Hand Cream ...,"I received my package of Neutrogena Hand Cream at the perfect time -- we had snow almost every day last week, and my hands were always red and chapped from shoveling. I used the Neutrogena Hand Cream before and after shoveling and had great results. NO RED, CHAPPED HANDS. Only a small amount was needed and it didn't leave any greasy residue. The hand cream had a clean, fresh smell -- not perfumed, like some others. I would overwhelmingly recommend this to all my friends."
2,It's working!,"Dr. Krystosik's book was the key I needed to finally begin to lose weight. It's not a diet, rather it's a change of lifestyle. And a pleasant one at that. I am not hungry and I am seeing numbers on my scale that I haven't seen in years."
1,Good product but not for me,"Product is good, but just didn't work for us. It's big and difficult to collapse. Don't even try to collapse the stroller while holding an infant. You need two hands. The infant's head knocks around from side to side. My 9 month old cries the whole time he's in it. I tried to jog w/ him in it but he screamed the whole time. The back padding is hard and uncomfortable for him."
2,Not as good as the first three,"Ms. Chute is Maine's premier author. Sorry, Stephen. However, in the Snow Man the character development did not match the intensity of the characters from Egypt, Maine. Also, it is hard to believe the entire scenario of Roger hold-up with Kristy and Connie. But, Ms. Chute's style and philosophy are there and that makes it wothwhile. If you are new to Ms. Chute try ""The Beans of Egypt, Maine"" first. If you've read any of Ms. Chute's other books, don't hesitate to read this one."
1,This book is not in a league with Chute's other work.,"I often refer friends to the work of Ms. Chute, for its raw realism, extraordinary character development, and ability to take one to places and situations never imagined. This book is the first time she has disappointed me (tremendously) on the first two counts, and while better on the third, still does not measure up to her other work. This book reads like a first draft or idea for a book, which is never adequately developed."
1,Hard to believe this was published,"As someone who enjoyed previous works by this author, I was stunned at how poorly written and conceived this book was. The characters are repulsive as are the sentiments expressed. Actually the incompetent writing is the book's saving grace: it is lacking to the point that at least it injected some (unintentional) humor into the proceedings. One of the worst books I've ever read."
2,An Everyday Pan in this household,"This pan truly fits its name. I use it for everything. On the stove or in the oven, it works great! Cleanup is easy as well. I haven't had any problems with the non stick surface and I've owned it for two years. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if and when the non stick surface wears off."
1,Ditto on the Prosine Inverter / Charger,"I'll second the previous review on the Inverter / Charger unit. I've had one on our boat for about 2 years now, and it's been nothing but a headache.It doesn't completely crash, but we frequently arrive at the dock to discover that it has shut itself down. It works again when we switch it off and then on again, but it is very, very annoying to have to do this almost every time we go out sailing (if not more than once).This product clearly has some big problems - indeed, the reason I found this product on Amazon is that I've started to look for a replacement. Does anyone have any ideas??"
1,"Avoid! Bad product, bad company.","Just want to reinforce the other negative reviews.This is a very sophisticated unit, and I was impressed with the amount of customization of the charger and inverter control system. To avoid problems with voltage drop from the battery bank I invested in (very expensive) 350 mcm cable and connectors and high amperage batteries. Testing was okay, but the first time it had to cover an extended power outage it gave up after very few minutes with an error code about battery voltage. Independent testing showed the batteries in peak shape. After that it faiiled immediately upon loss of utility power every time.Call to customer service basically said the unit was sold as a ""consumer grade"" product and repair service was not offered. I would have to purchase a replacement!I won't touch another Xantrex product for life, and advise all my friends to do the same."
2,Nice size!,"This is a nice size spatula. It is my second. This spatula stands up to the heat better than other spatulas I have tried, providing that you keep the heat under 375 degress. I did not keep the heat under 375 degrees(this is why I needed this replacement)."
2,Smaller than expected.,"It was a lot smaller than i thought it would be. It's a little bit bigger than a quarter. But it's good and sturdy, very good quality. I love my little key :)"
1,Can't handle the heat,"Before I go on, let me say I have lots of Calphalon products and only have had a disappointment in this utensil and the Pasta fork. Same reason on both, they are wimpy & overheat, not as in getting to hot to handle, but they become to weak to use. They do not hold up well under heat. The whisk is also not very sturdy where it need to be, at the bottom of the handle so you have support and a better grasp to beat your eggs, or whatever. I went out and bought a different one."
1,How much the novel Baldur's Gate suxs,I think the novel is not worth your money. The plot made no sense and kills off almost all the other players in the game except the main Abdel and Jahira. They killed Kaliid<cryes>
1,"No more, mr. Athans.","This book was the worst book i have ever read. The characters were unfinished - more like name and a short dialogue by that name between constant and mindless battles. There were no descriptions about anything - the city was just a city and differed from another city only by a name. The author has managed to ruin a good adventure and good theme by his unskilled and strongly boring writing. I truly hope, that this will be his last book."
1,horrible recording quality,Should have read other reviews before purchasing. Disappointed with very poor recording quality that makes it not worth listening to.
1,disappointed,I am very dissappointed in this book. Not what I had expected.It should be called a paper piecing book for log cabins. Since I am not a fan of paper piecing I would have been more careful in my selection.
2,Great,This book will help you know your cat better than you ever thought possible. It's a fast reading and provides lots of ideas about how to manage problems with your cat. Required reading for everyone who lives with a kitty.
2,nice with lots of spots for cards...,"It's hard to find a cover with the ID slot on the outside...I prefer the card holders run the other direction (side by side), then you don't have a lump at one end. So far it's holding up, we'll see as time goes how durable it is. The price was good, shipping was a little high."
2,Worth the money,I've used cheaper cleaners that leave streaks and leave residue. This stuff is great and the bottle will last years. I searched out PecPads (available from Amazon) after reading about the combination a photo magazine and online. I'd recommend using Eclipse + PecPads. I've had mine for about 6 months now. Works great and they're worth the money.
1,May not be what you expect.,"If you're looking for the percussive music genre Tektekan, then you're better off withThe Music of Bali, Vol. 3: Kecak & Tektekan.This is a recording of a dance drama, what you mostly hear is voices that declaim the dialog. There is also some simple percussion, with a small ensemble of bamboo slap sticks which play a just one simple sounding rhythm. Main musical interest is at the points where the rhythm ends slightly chaotically, which reveals that simple pulse is actually made up of a typical balinese type interlocking rhythm.Sound quality is good, just a stereo mic pointed at the performance, what makes this cd less inpressive is that it's not a recording of a musical performance."
2,"Works, but short cable","The battery works fine, but for my particular appliance (a uniden cordless telephone), I had to stretch the cable fairly tight to get the connector in. A longer cable (or different placement of the cable) would've been nice."
2,Primula tea,This is a wonderful product. The only thing I would like to see happen is that they sell the types of flowers seperatley rather than the variety pack.
1,not well made,bought several. two fell apart as I pulled them out of the wall outlets. these are jus not well constructed; doesn't seem like it should be a major production challenge to make something like this well; they are charging enough to expect a well made product. . . .
1,Worthless,Purchased this item for a dog heating pad. The temp was below 20 degrees for hours but it never turned on.
1,Does not wrok as advertised,"I have tried this unit several times to regulate the activation of a dog water dish heater. It does not seem to permit current to go to the bowl until the temp is well below 35F and blocks current at temps below freezing and so on some cold nights the bowl heater does not come on to keep the water liquid. I have monitored the unit's on/off activity independently of the heated water dish, so I know the problem is with the ""Weather Thermo Cube"" and not the water dish. I am required to manually plug and unplug the water dish to use the heated water dish. I cannot recommend the Thermo Cube."
1,possible junk,"I purchased 1 of the thermocubes in dec to help comtrol the heater in my dogs houses. The first cube that I received triped the GFI every time I plugged it in , I emailed amazon and they promptly sent another. I plugged it in and everything looked good but by then it had warmed up so it wouldn't trip on, so I waited. When it got cold enough (25 degrees, supposed to come on at 35 ) I checked again and it was turning the heater ,65 watts, on and off continously so I pulled it and threw it away. Lesson learned. Great idea just didn't work."
2,Much needed winter item!,This little thermocube is great for those cold days and nights. It is a time and energy saver. Thermocube takes care of turning my heat lamps on and off when needed. Highly recommend this to aid in keeping pipes from freezing; just plug a heat lamp in and direct it where you need.
2,It works as advertised,It was a good purchase and arrive on time as promised. I would recommend this item to a friend if you need to keep an outside pet warm
2,CHI?,GoT CHI? itz a good book READ ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITREAD ITNOW!!!!!
2,Adorable.,"This was the first Manga I picked up, I love it :) I've read it a few times in the short while I've had it. Even from the beginning, the characters are lovable (although, I might be a bit biased since I've watched most of the anime before buying the manga). However, at the beginning, the story has yet to really go anywhere. If you've seen the anime, you'll recognize a few of the events in here.There is some very mild nudity in this, but I can't see how this could offend anyone, if the female torso bothers you, you'll probably be bothered, but like everything, you draw your conclusions on it yourself, there isn't a label on it that says ""Fan Service!"", and I took it as a sort of insight in the innocence (or general airheadedness) of Chii.I highly recommend this, as well as the anime."
1,Great until they broke,"I purchased these because I have several other Calphalon kitchen items which I have been very pleased with. I really loved these tongs until after a few months of use they snapped into! I agree with those who said the tongs are just not wide enough for all uses. One day while trying to stretch them just a smidge to fit around something, they broke in half. If I had been applying a lot of pressure, I would have understood, but that wasn't the case. Another drawback is the fact that you cannot close them for storage and they take up too much drawer space. When these broke, I replaced them with spring loaded, rubber-tipped tongs by Amco Houseworks which have worked well for me."
1,weak and useless,"The only reason this tool merited a second star was the fact that it did a good job of not scratching the nonstick surface of any of my cookware. That said, that is all it did well. It is obvious just from looking at them that they have little to no 'clamping power' like you would experience in spring-loaded tongs. These work fine for moving a few sprigs of asparagus or green beans around a pan. Forget about using these on any cut of meat or anything weighing more than a couple of ounces."
1,Calphalon Tongs NO GOOD!!,"I was VERY disappointed in this item. I would actually give it 0 stars!! I tried turning a pork chop, a boneless chicken breast and even holding a baking bag open to pour contents into a serving dish and they wouldn't hold any of these things. I have thrown mine away and bought the locking metal tongs which I LOVE!!"
1,No way with hot oil!!,"I bought these because I love Calphalon pans and thought all of there products would be as high quality. Unfortunately, as I was frying tortillas to use in tostadas I couldn't pick up the tortilla to turn it over. Yet, when the tongs were cool they worked fine.... tried them again in hot oil and same result. Can't use these in very hot situations such as frying in oil."
2,Great Game- Much Better Than the Original,"Ticket to Ride Europe is far more fun than the original Ticket to Ride. In the original you would almost complete your route and someone would intentionally block you- creating much frustration. In this version of the game the creators have made it so you can build 'stations'- letting you complete your route with a small penalty. I also enjoyed with 'tunnel' and routes that require wild cards. This version has a lot more replay value than the original. If you like Settlers of Catan, Carcosone, Puerto Rico, then you will need to add this to your collection as well. Well worth the money!"
2,Great game,We take this game camping. We love it. It is a great game that will kep you coming back for more.
2,Great for Game Players,"If you love to play games this game is a must have! It is strategic and fun! This game takes a while to play so don't start it unless you have ample time to finish. This is the Europe version, but other versions are available (US, Germany, etc.) The object is to build trains along the paths your tickets indicate. As you build your trains along the map you are forced to use alternate routes to complete your tickeet as other people lay their trains along some of the paths you need. Once all trains have been built and played the person with the most points wins!"
2,Terrific family game,"We have two boys, 9 and 13, and we love to play games together. We have the original TTR & wanted to try this new board. It's a bit different, but just as much fun. It takes us almost 2 hours to get through with 4 people. We play games like Settlers of Catan, 7 Wonders, and Carcasonne. TTR is one of our favorites, though. We all prefer more of the European strategy games to typical games of chance."
2,Family Fun,"There are great, detailed reviews of TTR: Europe here already. I'll just say that our family loves playing this game. Our 7-year-old and 9-year-old beg to play it almost daily (our 5-year-old likes to watch but hasn't quite caught on). It was easy to learn (my 9-year-old and I worked it out through one initial test game) and fun to play. Through keeping track of their own points and using the map, my kids are getting a simple math facts workout when we play, as well as basic knowledge of the names and locations of the European cities represented on the map. Great game. Thumbs up from the two adults and two elementary-aged kids in our home!"
2,fast and excellent,"was very pleased with this item , fast and excellent service came in plenty of time for christmas was even prettier than the picture."
2,Greatest pan I have ever owned,"This is one of the best designed and functioning pans I have ever owned. Heats very evenly. Nonstick surface cleans beautifully. It is awesome for sauces, sauteing, and reducing. Glass lid lets you see how things are cooking without removing the lid and splattering all over, however the lid handle does get hot. Lid is designed such that you can drain fat or other liquids without losing any of the meat."
2,Just a dab will do ya!,"I use this after I wash my face and before I put on makeup. I use it morning & night in the winter, and at night in the summer, on my face and neck. It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area. One container lasts me forever! My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.This doesn't clog my acne-prone pores at all! And works wonders very quickly! (I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles!- I haven't gotten any yet!) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with. I highly recommend this!1smileycat :-)"
2,Complete authoritative guide to enlightenment,"A very profound book, which is exceedingly well written. I was astonished at the superb and erudite use of the English language as well as the amazing explanations. You will not find a better guide to enlightenment. I strongly recommend buying this book."
2,My best friend when I suffered from PUPPP,"During my pregnancy, I suffered from PUPPP. This was the best of a bunch of stuff I tried neutragena itch relief something, calamine lotion. Steroids were not recommended during pregnancy. Benedryl knocked me out but still did not take the itch away completely. Sarna was cooling. Relief was temporary. I carried it everywhere and applied liberally as often as needed!"
1,Ineffective and Major Stink,"I can't use this stuff...not only does it stink to high heaven, it does nothing but increase the burning sensation felt from chronic itch. Complete waste of money!"
2,Talent from unknown,"I first heard of tom mcrae when i heard a clip from one of his songs on an advert on Q t.v. It went striaght to my heart. The album is sheer quality all the way, His voice overpowers the music in such an alluring, calming way. If you like jeff buckley and david gray you'll love this. Its a must."
2,My kid loves the Bossy Frog,"Our daughter was given this album for the holidays and she loves it. She listens to it over and over, alone, and with her friends. They dance around and have a great time. We've even taken her to see Jeffrey perform The Bossy Frog in NYC. We highly recommend this album."
2,Quality Knife,"As a short review, I would quickly say that although I am a little disappointed in the 1 Handed Opening (I thought it would be spring assisted), I can't complain about any other part other than I wish it was larger- but hey, I knew it wasn't a big knife, and therefore I would rate it overall as a great little tool."
2,Good paper,This is good paper and produces nice photo's. I think high gloss is the best kind of paper for vivid color photo's.
1,"compared to other Calphalon products, this is just ""so-so""","We got this utensil free as part of a Calphalon promo when we purchased a set of their pots and pans (which we highly recommend), and I must confess that we get way more use from the other Calphalon products that we own than we do from this utensil.The function of this skimmer is too specific to be used for anything other than skimming and it doesn't always do a good job of that. The size of the scoop is excellent, but the width of the slots seem to be too wide to productivly skim on a consistant basis. We sometimes use this for scooping pasta, but any regular slotted spoon can accomplish that just as well. If you want a good quality Calphalon utensil, try the very multi-functional ""stir fry scoop"", which I would rate 5 stars. We use that ALL the time!"
1,Failed after two weeks,This power window regulator is craptastic in every way in what a good power window regulator ought to be. The upper cable broke off from the upper pulley wheel just after two weeks it was installed.
1,Somewhat outdated and little info on Park,"I was a little disappointed in the book as it did not meet our needs. I was most interested in ""inside"" info for Olympic National Park such as cool areas off the beaten track and insight into specific campgrounds. However, this book provided nothing beyond what you can easily find on the internet such as number of campsites, bathrooms, etc.The one time we tried to use the book to find a place to eat (in Forks), we were told that the restaurant that book highly suggested had closed down 2 years ago.Those who are going to the Peninsula to visit the towns (not the Park) might find this book a good and useful buy, but certainly did not meet our expectations."
2,A Terrific and Joyful Find.,"This CD is great. I am from Panama and I live in Michgan. This CD takes me back to my roots. I was looking for this type music. Although the Amazon reviews indicate this item is out of stock, IT IS IN STOCK UNDER ANOTHER NAME: DANZAS PANAMA SONGS OF THE MESTIZOS. You can find it under this title, or just Danzas Panama, or just Songs of the Mestizos. It is exactly the same item and Amazon has it. Check the songs if you want to make sure. I just got it, it is great, and we at home are enjoying it tremendlusly. You can notice the influences of many cultures in it. IT IS JUST GREAT."
2,"The best treatment of the ""6 days"" debate available!","I found this book to be the best scholarly treatment of the 6-days debate available today. Literal and non-literal views are presented fairly. This second edition is beautifully produced and makes several improvements over the first edition. It's profoundly theological but quite easy to read. If you are trying to make up your mind on this issue, I recommend that you own this book. Every seminary and chuch library should have a copy."
1,Not your ordinary snacks.....,"The taste is bitter, like some reviewers mentioned. It also has a pungent taste after the bitterness subsides. Very sour. Somehow it also tastes a little spicy, which was odd. We can't eat it just like any other snacks. Probably best as cooking ingredient or for making smoothies. As one reviewer pointed out, these don't look particularly fresh to us once we opened the bag. But then the expiry date is like one year away."
1,I never received the shipment,"I never received either the shipment nir an explanation from Amazon. I ultimately received a refund. A disappointing experience, not what I have experienced before. Is Amazon no longer a good source of groceries?"
1,Don't buy this book,"The book is full of errors. The quotations are misrepresented, the commanders are put in the wrong era (of the 6 Americans listed as fighting in the American War of Independence, only 1 actually did so; 4 of the others fought in the American Civil War, a hundred years later), other writings, such as Clausewitz' ""On War"" are denigrated. It's not an accurate, well thought out book, even for the young reader to which it is marketed."
1,Some good point--but can be very dangerous!,"While I found that Ezzo has some very valid and useful information in his book (ie routines are important to children). I also researched abotu Ezzo and how the method works. When Ezzo's principles are taken to extreme--they are very dangerous to the child's well-being. The AAP has issued many warnings about Ezzo--nis ideas, his supposed credentials, etc. Not only has the medical community spoken out against him--but so has his former church (who defrocked him) and Focus on the Family (concerning the religious version ""Growing Kids God's Way""). If you are going to read this book--please also visit [online] to learn about why so many people are concerned."
1,Horrible book,"This book is borderline child abuse. With all of the child abuse and neglect out there, this book is a thumbs down. Instead of encouraging nurturing and loving your sweet innocent baby, he encourages neglect. One day people will realize that letting their baby ""cry it out makes as much sense as washing their mouths out with soap, and hitting them with a stick or belt."
1,Sorry I ever tried Ezzo material,"Was taught Ezzo material at my church when becoming a first time parent. I felt the book enouraged an almost cult like following as if it were straight from the bible. While the book may say to be flexible, I found most people who taught it's ideas are not."
1,don't pay for next-day shipping,"I purchaced this book and paid the hefty charge to have it the next day. It did not come for five days. When I contacted Amazon, they said the would refund the shipping (after I spend over 45 minutes on the phone), but it never was credited to my account. Last time using Amazon."
2,Worked for both of my daughters,This book was a great tool for me in getting my daughters on schedules. I do not understand the cricism AT ALL!!! There was NEVER a time that my daughters were dehydrated or starving. The book is a GUIDELINE!! It is not about rigourous scheduling. If you read it closely you will understand this. I really don't understand how a parent would allow their child to become dehydrated or starving and blame it on the book!!! If that was the case they should have changed the schedule to meet the baby's needs!! The author repeatedly says in the book that these are guidelines...not absolutes!!!
2,Ezzo Success Story,"One of the reviews for this book refers to the the ""schedule"" feeding of babies up to 8 weeks old. In response to their review, I would like to recommend that parents consider the value of looking at the Babywise series. We know many parents who have followed the feeding plan suggested by the Ezzos (by the way, they do not call for strict schedule feeding but, instead, for a feeding process that is flexible and family-centered). In fact, all the parents we know who have followed the Babywise principles have had their children sleeping 6-8 hours at night by the time their baby was 6 weeks old.I think all of the Ezzo books are fantastic for learning how to raise a child to be self-confident, secure, and others-centered rather than self-centered."
1,Thumbs down!,"This gives so much bad advice based on inane theories it would be laughable if so many parents did not use the suggestions. The Ezzos have clearly done no biological or anthropological research whatsoever. People even *considering* this book you should know that their own church has released statements that they are in no way affiliated with the Ezzos, that their guidelines go against everything the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends, that all sorts of Christian parenting experts from Dr. James Dobson to Dr. William Sears have publicly made statements against the Ezzos and that Anthropologist Dr. Kathy Dettwyler has made statements pointing out the many mistakes in the Ezzos' theories. There are many, many better parenting books out there and I hope you consider one or more of them rather than this book."
1,This book advocates child abuse,"The ""parenting"" style advocated in this book is absolutely horrible and cruel. The author has no knowledge of child development or he would not suggest this kind of cruelty to children. Children will not be spoiled by receiving unlimited love and affection as he suggests. It's quite the opposite. Children whose needs are neglected develop problems, not children who can rely on their parents for love and affection.Feeding on schedule as is suggested in the book has been proven to damage children's health. Infants are designed to be fed on demand, not on schedule.The fact that Ezzo claims his approach is Bible-based is mind-boggling. He apparently has not read the entire Bible or he is choosing to ignore the parts that do not serve his purpose (New Testament). If you love your child, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,The worst advice I've received,This book was given to me when my first child was little after hearing him cry and taking the advice of the book I decided it was nonsense to wait and wait until he fell asleep. Babies cry because they need something. I gave this book back and still feel ashamed I tried this wacko method.
2,My baby is happy,"I've read some negative reviews on this book at this web site. All I can say is that thanks to this book, little Adam started sleeping through the night in his seventh week. He wakes up smiling every day. As Ezzo says in the book the sound of crying from distress is quite different from crying to unwind, so let them cry a little! There is nothing cruel about letting a child relax himself. Also, children are happy when they're in a secure, pleasant environment, not a sleep deprived and grumpy household!"
1,"You are having a baby, not getting a cat","New babies require a lot of time and attention. You may not get as much sleep as you are used to. It will pass. A newborn is not capable of learning your schedule and it can be harmful to do so. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that this book is dangerous to babies. If you want a new family member that you can feed on a schedule and ignore all night, then get a cat (and some birth control for yourself)."
1,Please contact me before doing this!,"So many ""Ezzo-ites"" claim the only people who don't like this book are people who haven't read it and haven't tried it. Well, not me! I read the book and took the class, and my husband and I tried this for about three months. I remember just dreading facing the day every morning. I felt liberated when I finally decided I didn't want to do this anymore.Months later, I still am so sad anytime I think about what we did. Thankfully my baby got enough food, but I really caused myself a lot of unneeded grief, and my baby had a lot of stress and unhappiness that she didn't need, for no good reason at all.Oh, and by the way, she didn't sleep through the night until almost seven months ... not that I even cared about that much.Please e-mail me if you are considering doing this. I want to save people from making the mistake I made. (...)"
1,not easy to read,"i expected more practical advices, but you have to read the entire book i guess , i didn't find it helpfull, to much stuff, all i need it i could find it online without paying for this book. all i have to say it was ok."
2,Excellent Advice and Guidance,"The concepts discussed are useful and wise. We have 2 children and have used these ideas successfully. Mr. Ezzo is unfairly attacked by people who have jumped on a bandwagon. Read the book yourself. Very few of the criticisms are warranted.In reality, our society would be much better off if the ideas suggested in this book became widely accepted."
2,Excellent Book!,"I have used this book three times. The longest it took to get the baby to sleep through the night was 12 weeks. I am thankful for this book because by the time my third came around, I needed all the sleep I could get! There was no napping for me by then! I used this book for my two youngest and for my Godson. The only one who has ever cried and fought naps was the one I DIDN'T use the book for! Even my 3 year old handles nap and bed times well! I buy this book for every baby shower I'm invited to. I found it to be a life-saver, especially with multiple children. You know exactly what to expect and when. When people babysat for me, they knew EXACTLY what to do when my baby started crying at exactly the time I said she would! You can't put a price on that!"
1,A Subtle Form of Child Abuse,"Although several points were interesting in this book, on the whole, I found many points cruel and disturbing. First, a baby should not be sleeping through the night at seven weeks. A child still needs nourishment every two to three hours at that age. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that a baby should sleep through the night at three to four months and the child will do it naturally NOT because you allowed them to scream themselves into exhaustion. If you don't want to be awaken in the middle of the night do not have a baby. Also the schedules are too rigid and don't allow for alterations. Use your best judgement and consult with your baby's doctor. Skip over this book entirely."
1,Ramblin Stream of disorganized ocassionally useful information,"Good luck getting a workable plan out of this book. It is so chopped up and convaluted you will pull your hair out. Yes there is some useful information hidden within the pages, but the plan is pretty much absent in any kind of clear concise way. The autor is a pastor with a masters, probably in pastoral studies, and I am sure he paid off the MD to put his name on the cover.A few clever analogies and a smattering of studies (500 kids) dont come close to quality research.Go with mindell - sleeping through the night -I'd trust the associate director of the sleep disorders center at a childrens hospital - with a PHD, way more than this guy."
1,CHECK THIS WEBSITE BEFORE PURCHASE,"[..]I'm not sure I'd want to listen to advice on parenting from a ""Christian"" who has been excommunicated from more than one church. Also, his children no longer speak to him! Some of the methods may ""work"", but what are they doing to your baby? Babies need to know they can trust their parents. Please, for your child's sake, read The Happiest Baby On The Block in addition to this, and go to the above website- hopefully, it will help you see why this book is BAD NEWS."
1,"Did not realize this was a platform for religious propaganda, etc","[...]that website pretty much sums it up. The AAP rightly condemns this book for promoting tactics that can lead to failure to thrive and severe dehydration. It's also one of several books by these authors, and most of the others are heavily religious, something I did NOT realize when gifted this book.My thoughts are pretty much along the lines of everyone else here who gave it a super low rating: It's extreme, severe, controlling, unempathetic, inflexible (despite what they say, there is little room for flexibility within their system), and based on imposed morality rather than humanity.There is some decent basic info here, but none that can't be found in a more humane form by someone who's actually got some kind of medical training or at the very least endorsements from pediatric organizations.Ezzo's own children are apparently estranged, and by the tone of this and other of his works, I'm not surprised."
1,wrong book received,you sent the wrong book - not even close - of course who is going to mess aound sending it back. What a waste of money.
1,This book is dangerous,"Newborns can be so inconvenient! Can you imagine coming into a place blind, unable to speak, unable to gesture, and ravenously hungry? All you can do is cry, and how dare you - the people God placed you with have a different schedule. Sorry, agenda. Tsk Tsk."
1,Terrible Parenting Advice,Babywise is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. It forces babies into unhealthy schedules which are not supported by current pediatric practices.
1,If there was an option to give this book NO stars that would be my preference,This book goes against all natural mother instincts within me. I was given this book by a friend when pregnant with my first child. I started to read it and was sickened by it. I finished it by force so I could say I really gave it a good go over. It was horrible. I personally believe that it only promotes that a parent detach from their child and the child stops trying to communicate once they realize that their parent will not help them or respond to their needs. I not only did not follow the recommended procedures I burned this book. I didn't want to aid anyone in getting this information.And the friend who gave it to me? She now regrets deeply the way she began parenting with her first child and has since revised her methods. She HATES this book now that she knows better.
2,Read PAGE 74,"And I quote, ""How often should I Nurse my baby? The first rule of feeding states: Whenever your baby shows signs of hunger, feed her!....As a general rule, during the first two months you will feed your baby approximately every 2 1/2 to 3 hours from the beginning of one feeding to the beginning of the next.""I'm wondering if the reviewers who gave this book 1 star actually read the book. Babywise in no way recommends starving or disciplining a baby. It gives you logical, concise, and in my opinion effective advise.From a loving mom of two.Keleigh Crigler Hadley author of Christian fiction series [...]"
1,Be Aware,"Parents should know before purchasing this book that the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a warning against the methods presented in it. For research and information about the dangers of Babywise, please visit www.ezzo.info . Parents should also realize that ""Mr. Ezzo has a high-school diploma and a master's of arts in ministry designed for non-college graduates that gives credit for life experience. He does not have any background in medicine, lactation, psychology, or child development. He is not in the position to contradict medical research and provide information on delicate professional topics such as infant nutrition, lactation, and child development. Furthermore, he has been publicly deemed unfit for Christian ministry by three churches spanning twenty years due to character related issues. "" (from Dr. Matthew Aney) Many of the medical ""facts"" presented in this book are blatently untrue, and in fact dangerous for your baby."
1,Regret buying without reading more about it,"I'm totally against the methods used in this book. I wish I had done some research before buying it instead of blinding following someone's recommendation. Parents, please use your instincts rather than books that make parenting easy instead of right."
2,I LOVE THIS BOOK!! Every new GREAT mom should use it!,"I read this book while I was pregnant and thought hey, I will give it a shot. I have talked with MANY moms who have used the Baby Wise method and they said it was wonderful and I HAD to use it! I'm so happy I did! My son is now 3 1/2 months and he is SUCH a wonderful baby. Everywere we go, people ask us: ""Is he always THIS good?"" - we proudly say YES! He was sleeping through the night - every night - by 7 weeks. He now goes to bed at 9:30pm and sleeps until 8:30am - he wakes up cheerful and happy! Our baby doesn't cry b/c he's hungry - we have him on such a great schedule that WE know when to feed him! Crying is the LAST sign a baby gives that he/she is hungry! I think it's cruel that parents would use crying as a signal to feed a baby! Thank you so much for this book - I HIGHLY recommend it to every mom!"
1,The AAP has issued a Media Alert against this book,"The practices in this book can be dangerous to you baby's health. If the American Academy of Pediatrics has an opinion on the possible consequences of a book on a baby's health, I listen! Please read the article at Babycenter before purchasing this book. I purchased and read the book. I was uncomfortable with some of the author's suggestions and decided it wasn't my parenting style. I later came across the Babycenter article and threw the book away. There are lots of other effective, more compassionate techniques for helping your baby sleep. I followed T. Berry Brazelton's advice for establishing a healthy sleep cycle for my infant with excellent results."
2,Sure has helped us.,"This is more than a book; it's a philosophy of child-raising, and it really has helped us with raising our first kid. We were clued in by some friends who had twins, who said they wouldn't have survived without BabyWise. Our son, Joshua, started sleeping through the night at 7 weeks. He's also the best-behaved infant our church has had in a while. As first-time parents, we have gotten TONS of advice, lots of it conflicting, and we didn't know what parts to take. This book has a holistic plan for our son's well-being, and it's working for us. Five stars."
2,Great So Far!,"I just recently purchased this book and am half way through it thus far. It's a very quick and easy read. From what I've read so far, it is going to be very helpful when my baby arrives! I definitely recommend reading it, if nothing else to help you form an educated decision on how you want to approach feedings and sleep with your infant."
1,Please Don't use this Book,"This is the only book that the AAP lists as dangerous.It goes against instinct, and can hurt your baby.Ezzo's grown children no longer talk to him ... I think that says it all."
1,I intend to burn my copy,"I bought this 7 years ago in desperation to get some sleep while my husband was commuting to Chicago all week for work. Schedules are a good thing, right? I just found the copy and intend to burn it. The concept that a newborn ""can decide on its own to play instead of cry during the allotted ""play time"" is absolutely absurd! This method assumes that a baby has much more mental and psychological abilities than possible for the age. I think that a lot depends on temperament for success and even so...a baby needs its parents. He/she deserves to have the love and attention to guide it into the world. Not given a VERY STRICT schedule and expected to cope. I could not ever feel right for the copy I purchased to ever ever ever land in anyone's hands. It's my review and I will say that it borders 'cruel'. I refuse pass it on to another infant's experience. Try other more compassionate methods to get your baby on a schedule."
1,A fundamentalist Christian approach...,"that twists scripture and that doesn't work!! Well, it might work depending on what your goal is. But to raise a healthy, happy, loving, confident child I would base on actual biblical teachings not Ezzo's version! I know well intentioned moms who used this method and underfed their child. I know many mothers who used this method and heard the same story over and over - ""I tried to breastfeed but by x months my milk dried up/wasn't enough/didn't keep up with the babies needs"". This book is off track biblically, medically and psychologically and is dangerous. We read and researched and glad we answered our babies needs and followed God's original designs. By the way, some readers might be confused as Baby Wise doesn't mention scripture etc, but it is just the secular version to ""Raising Kids God's Way""."
1,Dangerous practices,"Mr. Ezzo paints a nice picture with his theories, but they are unrealistic and his practices can actually be dangerous. The idea that an infant is capable of manipulation is plain ridiculous. Babies need to eat when they are hungry...not when it fits the parent's schedule. Breastfed babies often eat more frequently and serious consequences can be the result if a mother tries to fit the baby to Mr. Ezzo's 4 hour plan.I would not recommend this book to any parent."
1,Hated it!!,"I really disagreed with the author. His suggestion to feed your baby every 3 hours is crazy. Most people know the breastfed babies digest the milk faster and can get hungry faster than formula-fed babies. In the beginning, aren't mom and baby both learning? Don't we want our babies NOT to be hungry? Just because a baby ""snacks"" while nursing (nursing frequently) doesn't mean you should try to get them to obey a schedule. What about growth spurts?? Sure, the beginning days are tough and you can feel like all you do is nurse, but it doesn't last forever!If you are rigid and like to follow schedules, he's speaking your language--but don't expect baby to follow suit. Be sensitive to your baby's needs, not what Ezzo thinks they are. I also hate his advice on letting your baby cry it out. Hasn't there been enough said that it isn't a good idea?? Gosh, be gentle to your child--they are only a baby once!"
2,Loved this book,"This book was recommended by a couple of my co-workers who swear by it. I read this book and found many helpful techniques. I believe, as is the philosophy of this book, one should not be a slave to the clock (AKA a schedule) nor a slave to ""on-demand"" feeding. We, as parents, should find the balance which is right for our child. As with any parenting book I have read, I extrapolate what is helpful for both my child and I.Mr Ezzo does state strong ideas about the family bed and on-demand feeding which obviously offends some people, but if one is open to seeing beyond that one is likely to find helpful tools to add to their parenting tool bag. I have highly recommended this book to friends as I have found the techniques to be very helpful."
2,it works!,"This book is the BEST thing going. All of my kids were sleeping through the night by 8 weeks, on set nap schedules, and happy as can be. Plus, all of my friends and family that used it had the same experience. I recommend this to ANYONE -- 1st time parent or veteran. I referred to in constantly through the first 2 months with each of my kids. I give it as a baby shower gift to everyone I know who's pregnant."
2,Baby Wise is a must read for new parents,"I read all parenting books warily. This one has a great Bible based theory for training your baby. And Babies can be trained. I have definately seen the benefits to putting my baby on a schedule and I've practiced many of the methods of Baby Wise with two of my three babies and have seen the positive results. I'm not disciplined enough myself to practice all the recommendations that Ezzo prescribes, but what I have done has helped.I would say,even if you don't end up trying out the methods of Baby Wise, the benefits of the read are great."
1,Stay Away,"This book is dangerous--it seduces parents into a terrible detached mindset that endangers their lifelong relationships with their children. Think about it: why would a kid who was treated in such a punitive manner ever willingly confide in those same parents when a teenager? Also, don't buy the religious justifications for this theory--it's totally fraudulent. Children are gifts from God, not burdens that merely get in the way of ""date night""."
1,On ecoming Baby Wise,"I was absolutely appalled when I read this book. the authors promote, in my opinion, child abuse. The only way I could possibly recommend this book to any parent would be if they WANTED to raise a child conditioned to accept abuse from any authority figure during their lifetime. Denying a small infant food and comfort merely because an adult wants to sleep is highly irresponsible."
1,I do not recommend this book!,"Out of all the bad advice I received as a new mother, following this book was the worst! Fortunately, I had the sense to stop following this book and start listening to my own instincts when my son was about 2 1/2 months old.I recommend reading ""The Baby Book"" by Dr Sears, who was unjustly criticized by the authors of this book.(And by the way, my son sleeps through the night just fine, without following the methods in this book!)"
1,a disaster,"readers should know that not only is this book a disastrous discussion on child rearing, it is also a very controversial book...don't bother reading this book. you don't have to reach the page where the authors tell you that --if your 2 year old wets or soils his underpants and the floor that he should be spanked, and then told to clean up his mess and himself after-- to know that the authors are severe and even somewhat bizarre. there are better, well-written, thoughtful and humane books by educated and qualified authors to choose from..."
1,No to Baby Wise,"I was given both Baby Wise books ten years ago from my mother-in-law when our first baby was born. Unfortunately, after reading the book our first year was difficult at times because the book philosophy didn't really work. Some of the information in the Babywise books is helpful, but the same information is available in other baby books on the market. Advice to moms from a mom of four little ones age 10 and under, go with your instincts and don't read so many baby books. Find friends, fellow parents you can trust, and ask them questions. Then make your own decision."
1,faux expertise,"i'm still getting to know my baby, but it doesn't help to have some preachy, ""My way is the only way and all other child-rearing techniques create dependent, needy, unintelligent children."" If you're going to comment on the ineffectual nature of other parenting practices, cite some friggin' research to back up your opinionated claims...oh, that's right...they're just your opinions. millions of people turned out fine with a variety of different approaches to parenting. i'm all for flexible scheduling, but the book could have been a pamphelet rather than the self-congratulatory biting text that it is.JLangs, MSW"
2,Baby Wise is great place to start,I think Baby Wise is a great book. I have used the parent directed feeding with my first child who is now 4 months old. she has been sleepling through the night since she was 9 weeks old. My husband and I have taken the directions from the Ezzo's and have adapted it for our daughter. I think that is the key to using this book. Flexability in your routine is what has worked for my family. I have recomended this book to several friends and family. And I will continue to recomend it to everyone that has or is going to have a baby!
1,Yikes!!!,"Another bad baby book that promotes emotional DETATCHMENT.This book is a danger to children everywhere.Dr ezzo claims that babies do not remember being left to cry.Hogwash,I remember clearly and have been deeply traumatised for life.I now suffer from permanent sleep disorders and fear of the dark as well as a lack of emotional attatchment to my parents.I read this book purely out of curiosity.I was stunned at the coldness of this so-called christian man.My babies were rocked to sleep then laid down beside me right where God intended for babies to be.My children go to sleep easily without issue,in fact they were sleeping through the night by 2 weeks of age.Co-sleeping is the only healthy means of raising children.This book is a throwback to the cold harsh victorian era where selfish parents put themselves first and focused on training children like they are wild animals.I pity any child who is put through the riggors of this horrible book.Avoid this book like the plague."
1,Please don't endanger your baby by using this book,"This book advocates the establishment of strict control over an infant by the parents, including letting the baby ""cry it out"", and strict feeding schedules. The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) advises strongly against scheduling feedings for newborns as it may lead to poor weight gain, dehydration, and failure to thrive. Gary Ezzo does not have any medical background, and makes a number of misleading medical statements in this book. In fact, the church where Ezzo established the babywise practice has seperated itself from Ezzo. Babies need love, care, and closeness to their parents, not distance and scheduling. Please safeguard your baby's health by using the advice of your pediatrician or other medical professional, and NOT Ezzo's."
1,Horrible Book,"I'd rate it with a zero if I could. Ezzo's whole concept is just ridiculous and I can't see how it is beneficial for mom or baby. The part that gets me really irritated is that new moms that have no idea where to start can take this guy's writing as a godsend. But I warn any mom out there that making a baby adhere to a schedule will just make you crazy. The book itself annoyed me, the concepts annoyed me, and the fact that people actually continue to buy into the ideas in the book really concerns me. I just hope at least one mom reads this and believes me. There are plenty of awesome baby advice books out there. Try a Dr. Sears book or just plain follow your instincts!!!"
1,"Dangerous,AAP does not approve his methods...","I have read several of his books, including this one so that I could properly comment. The books are dangerous, misguided, misleading and you would think this man does not like children. His scheduling and sleeping recommendations have caused Failure to Thrive Syndrome in several infants, some of them requiring hospitalization, please do a search on Ezzo and read what has been said, his original publisher dropped him because they ahve found that his claims can not be proven and directly oppose the American Academy od Pediatrics and the AMA. Please refer to DR Sears series of books instead."
1,this method is cruel!,"By the time my order for this book arrived, my son was already sleeping through the night (at 11 weeks) despite not following ANY of Ezzo's advice. I don't think I could live with myself as a parent if I had let my son cry from the first week as Ezzo suggests. He was very colicky and crying much of the time anyways; funny, that didn't put him to sleep. Ezzo suggests NOT rocking your child to sleep and not letting him fall asleep while eating. He writes that happy contented babies are not born that way but created by following his method. I'm SO GLAD I didn't read this book before I had already learned the kinder, gentler way!"
1,"Babywise---It does the job, but so do nuclear weapons!","Babywise is written by a man with no medical training. He purports himself to be a Christian, family specialist. This is not the case. Read what his fellow Christians have to say about him here and why his publisher wanted to disassociate themselves:(...)Yes, Babywise does have some helpful points. The charts are good to keep track of diaper changes, breastfeedings and sleep. But, I will say that from experience, keeping your baby on a strict schedule while unknowingly your milk supply decreases can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. This will lead to far more heartache than a few nights of no sleep with a newborn. Remember that they are only babies once. It is a brief honeymoon in which to enjoy your sweet infant. Don't worry about overscheduling them before their time. The days of school, sports, recreation will have them overbooked soon enough."
1,The Advice in this Book is Dangerous,"Newborn babies do not need to be forced on a schedule. The AAP contradicts the statements in this book. It's misleading. It does not contain accurate information about attachment parenting, feeding infants or attachment in general. A lot of this advice could be potentially damaging, and, in fact it has been shown to contribute to failure to thrive, early weaning, breast milk drying, not to mention attachment issues from allowing a baby to cry it out.There is better advice in other books that can help parents to become more attentive to their children's needs without creating an adversarial realtionship from the very beginning. Newborns need to be fed when they are hungry, held when they need comforted. There will be plenty of time for schedules and routines when the child is older."
1,Before you buy Babywise,"Although you'd hardly know it from reading the reviews or thebook itself, Babywise remains very controversial. .................It is important that you understand the context in which this book was written. The premise and arguments are very seductive; they can even convince you that you are remiss as a parent if you don't implement the Babywise ""infant management system"". They are, in fact, mostly the parenting philosophies if the author and the science cited to support many of his claims has been called into question. Do your baby a favor and get the facts behind this book before you give in to it's promise."
2,priceless,"I used this for two infants so far and deem the information accurate and priceless, though I believe everyone should pick and choose what they will apply based on their own lives. Great principles in this book."
2,MUST HAVE,"This book was given to me by a friend and of all the wonderful gifts that first babies bring, this was the best. I have twins and they were sleeping peacefully through the night by three and half months. They go to sleep in a timely manner without much fuss and they wake up happy. Every parent should read this book."
2,hello exaggeratters!!!!,WOW ! talk about not acctually reading the book. Maybe some of the other reviewers shoud take a chill pill and try reading it again. They never say DON'T feed your baby or just let it cry. It gives very helpful information on making sure your little gift gets a full feeding. The only time they talk about anything that might not be common sense to most is to feed-wake-sleep schedule your little one instead of feed-sleep-wake. I would expect most people to understand it is not nessecery to run to your baby with your breast out at the drop of a hat! Tip: if a baby cries it is okay. Remembering that anything in excess is bad. This book has been recommended to me by some of my most stable clients and I have recommended it to others I know. The four stars is because this is only a guide book.
1,Dangerous if followed too strictly.,"I just spent two days with a family that is strictly implementing this program with their newborn. It was completely heartbreaking. The baby spent hours alone in her crib every day, crying while the parents went about their day seeming completely undisturbed and detached. They never even went in to check on her until it was time to feed again. I'm convinced the only reason she ever slept was from exhaustion. I've read the book myself and think it has some good ideas if followed with flexibility, but can't imagine having used it so strictly with a newborn. Please consult your pediatrician or lactation consultant before buying into this method 100%."
2,Great for first time parents,Loved this book. We give this to all our friends who are becoming parents for the first time. My daughter started sleeping eight hours at a time before she was three months old (even though she was nursing). It only took three nights and she continues to have wonderful sleep habits (she is now 2). Best thing I ever did!
2,who's writing the reviews?,"I have read quite a bit of the reviews written regarding this apparently controversial book. It seems to me that the ones giving it high ratings are parents who have actually read the book and used the information to help them and their babies-- their real life testimonies are more compelling to me as a potential buyer than the reviews written by those who seem to have raised no children of their own, who appear to be just bashing the book and quoting ""experts"" who support their view (I believe you can find literature written by ""experts"" to support any point of view). I am not even sure if those writing the negative reviews have read the book. I am going to let my buying decision be guided by those who have read the book and who have experience using the information contained in it."
1,Hitting an 8-month-old baby is NOT wise discipline!,"Why would anyone belive that swatting an 8-month-old baby is God's will? If God were standing in my kitchen I sincerely doubt he would recommend that I hit my babies. Discipline them, yes. Teach them, yes. Guide them, yes. I worry about the children whose frustrated, misguided parents would resort to these methods. Even James Dobson has called the program ""too rigid"". The American Academy of Pediatrics is concerned enough to be evaluating the impact of this book. There are many, many good books on discipline - please - for the sake of your children - pick another book."
1,"Dangerous, terrible book.","This book is dangerous, terrible advice for parents. Following this feeding schedule can result in dehydration or malnutrition for your baby. The author has absolutely no medical credentials, and the American Academy of Pediatrics denounced Babywise about a decade ago. Please read this Salon article for additional information: [...]I was given this book as a gift and thankfully my internal alarms went off about a chapter in. I finished reading the book just so I could write an informed review. Please do not buy or use this book. It's truly horrifying."
1,Please do yourself and your mothers intuition a favor and don't buy it,"Please, please just burn it.This is the worst book imaginable about listening to your baby and responding to him/her appropriately.Babies are born to be held, they are born to be loved... love them. There is no reason to put your baby on a strict schedule like this. All babies eventually evolve into a normal biological sleeping pattern similar to waking at 7am napping at 9, waking again, napping at 1 and sleeping at 7pm. It's natural and biological and happens to every human baby around the world. Don't give up yet. Just give your baby time and your baby will adjust. This is precious time, they will grow up before you know it and you will be sleeping again. Love them!"
1,Worst Parenting Book Ever!,If you actually love your child more than you love yourself you won't follow this book! Do some real research on Gary Ezzo...
1,This book is dangerous for your baby!!,"I was given a copy of this book and I was surprised it advocates waiting a certain period of time before feeding your baby. Babies have very high metabolisms and need to eat whenever they are hungry. I expressed my concern to a lactation consultant and she said that in the past week, she has seen two ""failure to thrive"" babies because the parents were using this book and not feeding whenever baby was hungry. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It teaches parents that babies are like little adults who can have everything scheduled away, which is so far from the truth. Babies will stop crying if you let them cry it out, and then they'll develop insecure attachments. I can't believe out-dated philosophies like this are still circulating and being followed. This book terrifies me and makes me feel so bad for all the babies out there whose needs are not being met."
2,Good info,"My baby girl is 7 weeks and I'm still referencing this book. I don't really think BW is the one and only way to deal with an infant, but I do think there are great chunks of information that is valuable to any new parent. If u choose to read this book definitely keep an open mind and maybe even try it for a while...there are some very helpful tips in this book."
2,An excellent Christian parenting guide,"We are a Christian family. God blessed me, my family, and our baby tremendously through the use of Babywise (1&2). The bottomline principle to the books follows right along with the Bible's teachings. Our relationship with God is to be of #1 importance, mom's & dad's relationship is second in importance, and third on the list of priorities is your children, loved and welcomed members of the family. After reading some of the negative reviews, I have a question: In what way are the principles or practices of these books Biblically unsound? I would sincerely like to see some responses from Christian parents out there."
2,A great guy,"I had this artist come play with my college jazz ensemble and let me tell you he was EXCELLENT!! and what a player! Check out his music, if it as good as he was to have here, buy it!"
2,Very helpful,"There are some wonderful suggestions here to make your day special. You will read this and remember the little things to do. One recommendation would be to direct readers to Katherine's Song, the wedding song in Defenders of the Holy Grail (Ken Agori)...this is THE song for this millenium. Of course, this may belong more at the service, but at the reception for the first dance, WOW!! THis book is worth the money..."
2,Self-regulation is the issue,"A postgraduate topic of actuality for psychologists and also an actual field of work both in institutions and schools, since lack of habit-formation in early childhood will reflect and impact goal-seeking opportunities both for the individual and for the labor group. More development needed on strategies to be applied to help colaborative work be successful through individual commitment. Since I am also a psychologist I found this topic very useful for university level, teachers and students."
2,Sweetgrass,"Interesting information about making sweetgrass baskets in South Carolina was beautifully woven into the storyline of this book. Anyone who visits Charleston after reading this book would look for the open-air market where the baskets are woven and sold. Excellent,easy to read low-country story in the author's style."
2,Excellent piece of work! Leaves you humming,The special voice of Jenny Devoe really makes the music. The vocals and instrumentation of many of these original tunes are excellent.
1,Not what I had expected,"I expected an actual notebook. Instead this was a small address book sized, no lined pad of paper. Good for jotting down a number or something, but not at all what i had expected. It was on clearence so not the worst $1.50 I ever spent. lol. pretty though."
2,Butterfly Notebook,Its a great little notebook for the money. No lines on the pages but a great price. I am very pleased with the notebook. Its great for doodles or righting. Well worth the $1.50 i paid.
2,Quality and good looks,"Finally got a set of the new Prof non Stick II series. They are not just good looking. Even heat, great non-stick performance, easy cleaning. I really like the stay cool handles- they do not get hot, so no need for pot holders all the time like with my old Calphalon Commercial. The glass lids are good, too - to keep an eye on simmering, etc. Overall- I love them. Also- good in the oven to 450 degrees- another very handy feature (especially at thanksgiving when all pots are in use and you want to keep things warm...). Watch out for the temp of the lid handles, though - ouch... Go for it- and add a 12"" regular (no non stick) to the collection for the times when you want a sticky browning pan. You'll be set for life.Folowup- Its 2004 now (originally bought in 2000) and we are still using the set daily. No signs of wear to the non-stick coating. Still very happy with them. And, they look good enough to hang up in the kitchen, which we did, freeing up tons of cabinet space!"
2,"Not Unreal, but not bad","Although some of the stuff from Unreal is here, it is not really a sequal. And it is not anywhere near as long.The different missions vary from excellent to mundane. It is very hard in spots, I found it better when set on Easy. But then, I like to look at the scenery...The second mission, in the forest, is very good and effective in making you feel immersed, almost as good as the original, and seemed more realistic than most games, at least to me.The missions are so different from each other, that if you don't like one you might like the next a lot.There is not much on the ship, but it is just enough to let you catch your breath.Be careful to pick up stuff at the end of missions, if you trigger the cutscene you can't get back."
1,Olay Complete old formula is returning!,"I loved this product, until last Fall (2009), when they changed the ingredients. Now it burns and makes my face feel hot. I checked out olay.com and found many reviews reciting the same issues.I am happy to report that Olay said they are bringing back the previous formula in April 2010!! Thank you Olay!"
2,Traveling Singing Man,"WOW!!! This one is pure magic. Justin has clearly done his homework in studying Johnny Bush. The duets are tight and wonderful and Dicky Overby and Rick Price do things with a pedal steel that will make you swoon. The material is classic with a wonderful twist. If you're a Johnny Bush fan, a Mel Tillis fan or just a fan of traditional country music this cd will become a favorite in your collection. I keep one in the car, one in the office and one at home. Enjoy...this one's a keeper.Christina - Colorado."
1,Flimsy,I am very dissappointed in this product. I have both the flat and the ballon whisk and both are too flimsy to really get the job done. In order to get enough leverage to whip I have to hold the handle very close to the whisk itself (read egg yolks all over your hand). Not a functional kitchen tool.
2,Halloween sing a long,This is such a cute children's DVD. My kids watch it over and over again every Halloween and love to sing along. It's a little annoying for the adults but it keeps our kids happy and gets them in the Halloween Spirit!!!
1,Description Error,"This statement appears in the Product Description. For use in the best-selling Savio Skimmerfilter or Compact Skimmerfilter. It does not fit the COMPACT Skimmerfilter. Use Savio Ultraviolet Clarifier - 18 Watt, Model# SUV018 for the compact skimmerfilter"
1,Price - are you JOKING?,"I purchased this from Adorama Camera through Amazon last year and the year before, and at 3 boxes each time, still paid LESS THAN HALF what this appears to cost! Why would you pay $168 and change, plus tax and shipping when 25 of the same paper is less than $20????? I don't like math, but I'm smart enough to add it up - this is ridiculous!Bottom line - LOVE the paper - LOATHE this price when I can get it elsewhere for significantly less!"
2,The Compass Inside Ourselves Review,This early collection by Nancy Lord provides a collection of stories about women who come to realize they have within themselves the strength to express and follow their own true guides. While the short stories are only brief snap shots of th3 awakenings by the subjects of the stories - they cause reflection. Later writings by Lord illustrate her growth in depth as a writer - but the stories are excellent.
2,Essential Australian Hard Rocker,"Ball Power is an album that should be held in high regard in every part of the planet where harder edged rock is appreciated. Prior the releasing this album Lobby Loyde (lead guitarist/vocalist) had been part of legendary Aussie bands such as the Wild Cherries and the Aztecs as well as releasing the excellent solo album ... Plays With George Guitar. Ball Power confirms Lobby Loydes status as Australias greatest amplified guitarist.Originally released with nine tracks, Aztec Music has added seven extra tracks including the 16 minute GOD (originally released on the compilation 'Summer Jam'. Original album tracks such as Humen Being, Flash, and Hey, Whats Your Name are some of the finest song ever recorded in Australia. The cover of Whole Lotta Shakin' is also mighty fine.THis could be the best hard rocker ever to come out of Australia. This CD is essential listening to anyone with even the slightest interest in Rock music with a harder edge."
2,A great book,"This is the best Russian grammar book I have ever bought. It explains how Russians really use verbs and does not just give you a dirrect translation. It will help you speak Russian how Russians speak it. It is a must for anyone studing Russian in college, and it is escenial for anyone who has to write papers or stories in Russian."
2,Information packed powerhouse!!,"The best little book on the subject that I have been able to find. Very thoroughly explains most ""in's and out's"" of the handwritten word. Helpful and informative, start with this book and it may not be necessary to buy an other book about handwriting analysis."
1,Best of the Best,"This book takes you where most books on marriage and relationship never take you. One of the problems with ""help and guidance"" books is that most never really address the roots and foundations that experience and life are really built upon. Mike addresses the essentials in a very artistic manner that draws you in and causes you embrace those mysterous truths about marriage and the relationship between a man and woman that most of us miss, unless we are willing to pursue the depths. Include some ""practical"" books on marriage, but don't leave this one out of your ""must read and apply"" library."
2,"This book is a ""Ten""","""The Mystery of Marriage"" proved to be a great book, shallow in the least. With spirituality in mind, it offers much insight into relationships, past and present. I would recommend it to anyone seeking an understanding of what risks vs. rewards are involved in real spiritual bonding between two people, self, and God. If you have ever contemplated the mysteries of marriage, this book is for you.Grant Johnson"
2,From Skeptic to Fanatic,"For most of my 7th and 8th grade year, a few of my friends were chomping through these books while I found it easier to jump on the bandwagon and make fun of them for reading them. But then in 9th grade, I picked up one of the pre-cataclysm books and started to read it. I finally realized why they loved these books so much. They were a perfect mix of mystery, of magic, brute strength, mythical beasts, comedy and romance. I'd never read such perfectly balanced books in all my life. I found myself reading the books during the 9 months of school. When the school year had concluded, I had read 15 of the books from the DragonLance Saga. Each one was unique in its own way and gave you a different perspective on the entire land of Krynn through the eyes of different characters of seperate races. Ever since I started reading these books, my creativity has been stoked and I can't stop reading the books and writing my own stories."
2,A classic for the new century,"I have read this book over and over again and each time I read it, it gets better. It has a great storyline, great characters, great action scenes and great humour. I've made my friends read and they are all happy when they do. I play AD&D and I have to tell you I wouldn't have gotten into it if it weren't for this book. My favorite character is Tas. This book is the reason I started reading fanatasy novels and I have to say my life would'nt be the same if I hadn't."
2,La misma historia! No puedo escuchar su musica actual!,"Aqui tengo el disco que Usted me regalo con su firma y conservo 2 retratos donde estamos juntos. Fue un bonito dia. Y debo admitir que me costo bastante dar con Usted, pero cuando uno se propone algo, tambien se le da con un poco de suerte e insistencia, verdad? Mucho me gustaria poder opinar mas ampliamente sobre los dos CD's, tenga la bondad de disculparme si regreso al pasado, aunque el presente tambien puede ser excelente, es muy dificil para mi dar una opninion. Usted me comprende por favor!"
1,Not smooth. Very jerky.,"No matter what camera you put on it, the motion is not fluid it has a slight jerk. If it was $99 bucks or less I'd keep it but at the $130 I paid just not worth it."
2,Great product for the price,"I replaced an older inverter with this one and it is not only smaller, but quieter as well. Easy to install and all in all great value for the dollar."
2,Gorgeous & Uplifting...GREENMAN!,"This is my first XTC album, but I LOVE IT! It is stunning in its musical genius, and Andy Partridge can really belt out a tune. Greenman is my favorite, with its luscious, swirling orchestrations and heart-thumping bongo drums. Exquisite; XTC."
1,After 7 years' wait: a total disappointment.,"I had been listening to XTC since ""English Settlement"". I liked some of their earlier work, and saw them improving with every album. ""Nonsuch"" is a great album, and after waiting 6 or 7 years for their next CD, when this piece of ship came out, I was one of the first buyers. Couldn't wait to play it.... I thought... these guys must have spent the last 5 years listening to Charly Garcia records, because this garbage could not possibly be that bad under no drugs! The selling price for this album says it all: under a dollar, compare it to Skylarking, English Settlement, or Nonsuch, and you'll see why some people are as eager to sell this CD online as quickly as possible. Unfortunately I wasted almost twenty bucks- on this CD, no used record shop would take it, so I threw it under the subway tracks. The rats can keep it. One of them replied to my review unfavorably."
1,Poor quality video,"I wanted to get some video tapes of Alaska for my elderly Mom, since she remembers Alaska fondly from her childhood. I thought that these videos might be dated, and not the greatest in cinematography, but I didn't think she'd really mind. They are pretty much what I expected, except that in addition to the above, they are also taped at EP speed instead of SP. I've never heard of a video for sale being taped in EP mode, and as you might expect we couldn't get the tracking to work properly. Total junk."
1,Whoa!,The excerpt published by Amazon just above these reviews has errors in grammar and consistency in the first two paragraphs. Is it LeSoit or BeSoit? They're both used for the same person in almost the same sentence. Commas are not used correctly and some words run together. Maybe someone typed the excerpt by hand?
1,Too much talking...,"I didn't know that this is some interview or something. I of course have no idea what been said, but what music there is on is great. Perhaps 3 songs in complete form.Don't get me wrong, I love Alexandre, I think he does great music."
2,Best biscuit recipe in the world.,"I had the good fortune to come across the original edition in a thrift shop for two dollars. Camille Glenn was a genius before her time. The recipes are attended by her wonderful stories, and her advice to 'use local, fresh ingredients in season' came generations before the slow food movement. I love this book. You won't be sorry you tried this out. She was a gifted writer and cooking teacher and so she explains how to make each dish, and gives a little history behind most of them."
2,Radio Flyer Big Red Classic ATW,"We purchased the Radio Flyer wagon for our twin grandaughter & grandson's 1st birthday. The wagon arrived the day we were told it would, and it was in excellent condition. No dents, or scratches! The carton was delivered with a hole in it, but no problem with the wagon. The quality is terrific. Even our 3 yr. old grandson was able to ride in the roomy Big Red Classic with his little sister & brother. It will be a classic toy around for many years!! Thanks from Quinn, Avery & Gavin's Grandparents"
2,Radio Flyer Big Red Classic,"Toy is easy to assemble. Disappointed that this wagon is made in China. Also disappointed that instead of carriage bolts to attach frames for wheel to the wagon body they are using a screw head that is soft and difficult to tighten as the screw driver, flat head, is hard to keep secure when tightening the nut. Does not seem as well built or as durable as the Radio Flyer from my days. Time will determine the durability of the product. So far my grandson likes it!!"
1,Misleading Title,"This is an out-of-print book that I paid a small fortune for. There is very little out there on the topic of desiging and building a house on a difficult site. Regrettably, I have now discovered the title of this book is extremely misleading. Nearly all of the houses shown are built on large level pads (!?!). A few are partly constructed on the gentlest of slopes. None of the project locations shown here would remotely qualify as a ""difficult site"" in California. There are no ""zero-lot-line"" lots, no real hillside lots. Nothing. Further, all of the home plans (except one) are for highly conventional and rather unimaginative traditional designs, similar to those found on numerous house plan websites. What a letdown. If one of these books becomes available, don't be tempted."
1,10-Movie Mega pack V.3,"I thought it was going to be Hallmark movies and we try to watch just family movies without any bad language or smut. one movie was Sex and Mrs X, Another Womans Husband. We didn't even watch any of them. I guess it was my fault for not paying closer attention."
1,Very annoying phone,"Amazingly poor phone. Although Uniden can be good at times, this one is virtually worthless:1) The keys on the handset began to wear out after just 3 weeks of use. By 4 months, only 2 of 12 keys were legible. (My nails are quite short.)2) It's very hard to turn the ringer on and off: You literally have to press 6 buttons to get the ringer tone to turn on or off.3) Callers who want to bypass the recorded announcement (outgoing message) by hitting pound can only get it to bypass after pressing pound about 4 times (it works inconsistently)4) If you want to monitor your incoming calls, you have to listen to your outgoing message each time a call comes in (can't turn it off).5) This is obviously a phone prepared for a European market that was dropped onto the American market. Date stamp is not in American format.6) Support staff at Uniden were rude, to put in mildly, and obviously not interested in being helpful to customers."
1,Last Review . . . Don't Bother.,"I didn't like this movie at all, in fact I think it was a waste of money."
1,"Nice idea, poor execution...","As a part-time rehabber, having an all-in-one bathroom lighting and accessories solution is a dream come true. Unfortunately, while this set looks good, the actual product is very flimsy and cheap feeling. This is especially true of the toilet paper holder, towel bar and towel hook. Everything is very, very thin and easily bent/damaged. (Not to mention that the paper holder is just, well, weird.) My reccomendation would be to look for something with a little more heft."
1,The worst muffin book I've ever used!,"DO NOT waste your money on this book! It's the worst muffin book I have ever seen. Bland, boring, tasteless muffins. I don't know what book these positive reviewers are talking about, it can't possibly be this muffin book! Don't buy it!!!"

1,drops connection,"The first one I got dropped the connection after a bit, so while it was fine for synching it was no good for charging. The second one worked great for about a week and then it started to drop the connection as well. I did not try again. My friend got one at the same time that has always worked fine for him."
2,Bladder Cancer all purpose Vitamin,"This particular brand and combination multi vitamin was referred by a doctor friend in California who was in turn informed of this vitamin's specifications that were part of a regimen of vitamins and supplements in helping stop recurrence of bladder cancer. I have been taking this from day one, and so far, no recurrence. Thanks for the reference Docs!"
1,Save your money on this one,"This CD, which is titled ""Subway stories,"" which was an HBO special released in 1997. This CD is neither an OST (Original Sound Track) or Score, but occupies some plane between the two.Although one of the most memorable musical items is ""Subway stories"" acted by Bill Erwin, but evidently played by Mecca Bodega. It is one of the few that are ON this CD.If you were expecting the excellent Sax Cantor Riff, sung by Taral Hicks, it is not there, nor is the excellent Jewish tune by Dan Rous as the Jewish Cantor.Otherwise, the CD is mediocre at best. It could have been better by including some of the other significant music from the movie."
2,Nice Mix of Style and Attitude,This CD has something like the style of Buck Owens with the attitude of the Beatles. The result is a really fun collection that makes the steel and twang irresistable. Don't miss Raspbery Beret.
2,Strong Follow-Up,"While Hans Zimmer's Second Gladiator CD is not as good as the first, it offers refreshing remakes of tracks on the first CD. Now We Are Free, Juba's Mix balances the score by adding a more relaxing mood to the already powerful and anxious tone of the other tracks on the CD. It would have been nice to see more material from the movie and less music which didn't make Gladiator's Final Cut. However, it demonstrates Zimmer's incredible talents and is ejoyably entertaining to listen to."
2,"Hans Zimmer ""Gladiator"" Soundtrack",Great orchestra music offset by melodious singing and a few catchy audio clips from the movie
2,Beautifully illustrated and told,My four-year-old daughter loves this book. She asks for it over and over. Tonight I even caught her looking at it under her night light. She doesn't want to return it to the public library tomorrow so I quess I'll be ordering our own copy soon. The story is beautifully illustrated with bold lines and attractive bright colors. And it is just as beautifully told in simple yet well wrought lines.
1,Awful ASM Book,"This book is about as much fun to read as the ""AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 3: General-Purpose and System Instructions"" manual. I agree with many of the other reviewer's bad comments about this book:* mainly full of charts and opcode tables that you can get for free from AMD and Intel* not funny (NASM MASM TASM WASM and Batman... what's the difference again???)* after chapter 1, he hasn't covered how to write an assembly language program, not even a simple one (chapter 1 is full of gibberish)* after chapter 2, he hasn't covered how to write an assembly language program, not even a simple one (chapter 2 is full of C++)* after all chapters, he STILL hasn't covered how to write an assembly language program, not even a simple one* he's the type of author that wastes space talking about and trying to get you to buy his other books* the book reads like a reference manual and assumes that you already know assembly and how to use MASM"
2,Underrated,"This movie is funny, action packed, All known monsters & All around fun movie, didn't get the box office like the other crap gets but this is a great movie for horror monster lovers with a little comedy thrown in their..trust me you will like it if you have taste:)"
1,Routine and predictable,"Uninspired movie making. Routine and predictable. Violates the basic storytelling law ""Show, don't tell"" in practically every scene. The only saving grace is Sam Huntington as Marcus who energizes every scene he is in with his spot on dry and funny delivery."
1,"Strangely, the game is better then the book.","Most of the time the book is better then the movie, etc.Not this time.Maybe it was my fault for playing the game through before reading the book, but this book was run of the mill fantasy dribble.I read it through in two days but i cant say that that was because of how enjoyable it was. I read it quick so i can move onto another book.As of right now the game can probably be got for as little as this book. If youre interested in DnD or Planescape, pick up the game. You wont be sorry.But stay away from this book!"
2,Ultra Force Mini Hammock,"I love my camping hammock!! Its light weight for hicking, and easy to set up all I need is two trees'. It is very strong. Just what was in the description. Great for one person. Its long enough for my husband to lay on and he is 5ft/11 in, and weight is 279llbs. It is a great product!!"
1,Sorry I Wasted the Money,"We loved this pool for three weeks, which is as long as we had it. This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4"" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic. I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours. A total waste of money."
1,A lot of work,I bought this pool for me and my little brother. I thought it looked big and about knee deep. The fact is it is only 15 inches deep because if you fill it up past that the wall will collapse. It is also smaller than it lookes. If you have small kids it is perfect but not fun for bigger kids.
2,Ahh.... cooling off made easier!,"My husband and I purchased this pool on sale, figuring it would be nice to sit in during the dog days of summer. We got it inflated and filled in around 2 1/2 hours, using a $5 hand pump also purchased at Target. This is probably the best $25 (pool and pump)we've ever spent! Filled up (to the top tier), the water comes up to our chest when we are seated. The sides are firm and comfortable to lean up against. We are thrilled with our purchase - we call it our &quot;spa.&quot;"
2,mickey dvd,We own this and we have given this DVD as a gift. It is a cute movie and my kids like it.
1,Mickey Saves christmas,The tv show that is on weekly is educational and problem solving. But if your kid is over 4 Don't bother with the DVD. It's cute but tiresome after 10 consecutive watchings
2,Mickey,On time and gave my 1 year old daughter Christmas Joy. Keep up the good work. Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is great.
1,if you like rust buy this item,within 4 months of purchase the pole rusted very badly and started staining the tub. I had to replace it with one of better quality. I would not buy this item again
1,Interesting Piece of Software,This program is very difficult to control and doesn't have very good quality graphics and stuff. I think anybody looking to buy this piece of software should maybe consider something else.
2,Excellent quality,"The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that for someone with small wrists like myself, this band has a lot of extra length. The choices are to trim it, which risks eventual fraying or tuck it under which I have done.If you have normal or large wrists this is a non-issue, the band is of very good quality and looks fantastic."
2,"Superbly written, thoroughly informative, totally engaging","From the Renaissance era down to the mid-19th century, terrestrial and celestial globes were not only instruments of science and education, but works of art and highly prized craftsmanship. In Sphaere Mundi: Early Globes At The Stewart Museum, Montreal, Edward Dahl and Jean-Francois Gauvin successfully collaborate to provide the reader with a history of the Dutch, English, French, Italian, German, and Swedish globes, drawing upon the holdings of the Stewart Museum in Montreal, Canada beginning with their earliest globe, circa 1533. The superbly written, thoroughly informative, totally engaging text is wonderfully enhanced for the reader's pleasure with 120 full color illustrations and charts the developments and changes in more than 300 years of globe making. Sphaere Mundi is ""must"" reading for students of cartography and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the history of science."
1,can we say con?,the product shipped with this order is NOT what's described here. It only drives off rodents from one room using ultra-sonic waves. no emf and NOT 5000 square foot. Also no insects. This is not worth the 30 dollars in any way shape or form.
1,Terrible transfer - product should be dropped,"The film is a low budget production, but about what you would expect... I wasn't particularly impressed with the script or the production values, but overall, acceptable. The problem is the DVD transfer. It may be the worst I have ever seen. Reel changes remain visible, the color is washed out, and the audio becomes garbled to the point where one can barely follow the plot in the last scenes of the film. Amazon should drop this product until the distributors remaster the DVD."
1,W T H Was I Thinking?,"The title pretty much says it all.The trailer was more entertaining than the movie.Definitely a loser of a movie, and $0.99 for the rental would have left me feeling cheated, so now I feel cheated four times over for $3.99 rental.Want to waste $4.00 and save yourself some time, then throw your money in a river and walk away."
2,Great Flash,This flash works flawlessly with my Cannon Rebel XTi. The reach capability is day and night difference with the built in flash. The flashes automatic zoom works well with the lens zoom action. Multiple image / multiple flash is no problem. Fast recovery meant no missed shots for me as opposed to the built in flash requiring having dead time while recharging.I have not used all the features but for straight shooting this flash is a great enhancement for the Canon Rebel XTi.Sigma EF-530 DG Super EO-ETTL II Electronic Flash for Canon EOS
2,ADORABLE,"WE needed one of these for our children, so we wouldnt have so many baby doll stuff, this has EVERYTHING...I do have 3 boys and a girl (3 year old b/g twins and 8 month old b/b twins), so yes the color threw me off a bit, but what baby station isnt gonna be girly?! It is very durable and holds up to constand abuse. We keep it in our basement, the playroom... so size insent an issue. Theres a baby bath, a crib/ changing table and places to put babies things... really cute.. theres a mobile and it even comes with bottles and lotions... We keep many babies in here and its just great to have... The only thing it doesnt have is a highchair... but thats okay... we bought one. So the only baby things we bought were this, a highchair, a stroller(s) and babies... great great great fun for all genders and ages!"
1,shame on the label,"The mastering on this CD is so bad, it's painful to listen to. The release location for this is listed as Miami, and it sounds like it's an amateur bootleg, transferred to cd by someone without the slightest amount of care for the music, or skill with the equipment. There are releases form the 20's that sound better than this; heck there are salvages off wax cylinder that sound better.That is a shame, as Estrellas Cubanas delivers some of superb charanga descargas.Here's hoping a legit label releases albums form this excellent but neglected band."
2,a historical worth reading,A must read for all of those who long to catch a glimpse into the medieval days. A great well thought out plot and story line that follows the struggle of the Lady Rowena trying to manage what life has given her as best as her circumstances allow. I loved following along and seeing her spirit. This is a must read.
2,The Book on Human Nature,As you read each line you can feel your Internal Being vibrating in attunement with each word written. Truly a masterpiece in the origin of mankind and the true nature of the Soul. Well done Kober Press for this great translation of such a difficult subject.
1,Not for big dogs... won't last long!,"While it's a cute little toy for a dog with small teeth, it doesn't last long in a house with one or more big dogs. I think the thing lasted about 15 minutes before there was stuffing everywhere..."
2,Great finish to a great story!,"This is the 2nd time I've read this series of two books. I loved them both! There's a little bit of everybody that you know in these stories. This is an allegorical tale that follows a group of those who are broken and abused in one way or another. Mercifully, God comes to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. He loves, redeems, and gives them new life and hope for their futures.In this, the second book, it continues the journey they all began, as they now have to learn that even though their lives have been made new and whole again, this world will still offer them challenges and trials. In the midst of those trials, they find they have choices to make as to whether or not they will continue to walk in their new found freedom in Jesus Christ."
2,WAITING,I have always enjoyed this series. Waiting for the final Season 4 to bereleased to complete my collection.
1,"If you Can't Do It Right, Don't Do It At All",That's pretty much all I have to say about what CBS/Paramount did to THE FUGITIVE series.
2,Great patio fan,"This fan is holding up great on the back patio in the high humidity. The lights are bright at night. The blades are stylish and give that ""relaxing in paradise"" feel. I am very happy with the fan."
2,"What's your theory, Darwin?","Ok, so it's corny, goofy, slapstick but it's still a lot of fun. Sort of like Austin Powers with mischievous chimps. I have fond memories of watching this series as a youngster in 1970, but one of the main reasons I purchased this collection was that proceeds from the sales go to Lancelot's Retirement Home, Los Angeles' Wildlife Waystation."
1,Not a practical solution for the problems today or tomorrow.,"First of all, this might not work in academia, though it may keep class in session a while longer. It certainly will not work in the larger world, because 95% of the people will not read or understand it. Even if they did, I doubt that they would buy the staunch evolutionary rhetoric, much less get into the religion of FLOW. It amazes me how so much study results in theories of so little relevance to mankind. ""Nice try, sire, but what shall we tell the PEOPLE?"""
1,bosch vs dewalt,"Well dewalt is clearly better if you can have only one or two drivers in your tool box the chuck is ok- even the chucks on cheap drivers are ok. It is good for tight places, doesn,t have much power, probably as much as i'd expect from a 3.6 volt driver and the electric clutch is not as good to screw as mechanical clutches People will probably disagree with me, but I own and use 6 different drivers and that's my opinion. Not good for large screws, too weak, and the clutch adjustment is dismal if you are looking an accurate and consistent setting. I hope bosch works on improving these shortcomings so the tool can live up to the bosch reputation. For drilling ,don't waste your time."
2,Amazing...,"This book has captured the essence of Jackie's life, not only during her JFK years, but in her post-political life as well. It portrays her as an adventurous, spirited woman vaulted to an American icon by her adoring public. Spectacularly written, I was highly impressed."
2,"Ok, but can but a lot better.","Somtimes this m:robe can be a little complicating. My dad was trying to download the software onto our computer to download songs from my cds, but it would not work. So he called the company and they said the software only works on certain computers. So I ended up using my friends computer to download the songs onto my m:robe. The touch screen takes a little while to get use to. Also the m:robe screen get scratched REALLY easy so be careful there. Overall I give this mp3 player 4 stars."
1,Don't bother buying.,I would not recommend purchasing this player. The software for synching it to a Windows PC is not user friendly and I frequently encountered errors when trying to load music on to the player. The player itself seemed to be very slow when it came to loading a newly selected song. Much slower than what I have experienced using an iPod and Creative Nomad MP3 player. My player has been sent in for repair three times for issues with the firmware. I therefore would suggest passing on this one unless you like a product that does not work reliably.
1,Disappointment,"I`ve bought the second edition of this book following the recommendation of my predecessor.My impression, however, is pretty much the opposite:- miserable didactic style (the first chapters are trivial, the rest is just a mess of hieroglyphics, thereby lacking mathematical conscientiousness)- far too little intuitions (even if easily implementable)- cumbersome or missing explanations and algorithms- patchy definitions- typos (whilst no errata could be found on the internet)- inadequate exercisesBesides, the physical quality of the book is bad as well:One has to use considerable force otherwise the book won`t stay open (if you want to work with several books at a time, for example).When using highlighters, there will be marks on the backsinde of the page as well.The book is overpriced as well (~$85)."
1,What happened?,"Love Has Come Around is supposed to be on this cassette, but it isn't. Also, does anyone know on what LP or cassette or CD I can find Butterfly and Love Has Come Around, featuring 125th Street, N.Y.C.? Thanks."
2,Good Solid Disc,This is Another Good Collection of Music By The Genius of Donald Byrd.The Arrangements are very Strong.His Work is Timeless.Very Well Produced.A Good Fusion.
1,Predictable,"The first half of this book was very good. The characters seemed believable and I actaully had hope for this pre-teen book. but once the second half hit, it went downhill. The whole story line switched, everything was predictable and it had the most cheesy, sappy, happy ending of all time, which was tottaly ironic (not the good ironic but the stupid ironic) since the main charcter is not into the cheesy and sappiness of life. This book has tottaly turned me off to any and all Hailey Abbott books."
1,Not Too Helpful,"I was a little disappointed with this book. When I bought it I thought it would be more of a collection of spells and charms. The most useful part of the book were a number of quick cure type charms which would only be helpful to a novice. Most of which, I now use other spells in place of. Many facts I even found false, and others were only half truths. Frankly, I learned more about true magick from talking to friends than from this book. It was only good for an entertaining read."
2,love it,i had this cd when it came out and am so glad to refind it i love Michael English he is so moving and i find him to be goosebumppingly awesome !! i recomend for any one not just christian music followers :)
1,Not Great,"Thankfully, this video didn't cost much. There were a few segments that I was glad to have. But it was obviously thrown together in a hurry and the editing was horrible. The narrator's comments frequently didn't match the pictures or video clip. They would show a picture or video clip that was not the same time period the narrator was speaking about. Not well done."
2,good read,"This is a good, quick read. I know a number of friends who have it and everyone seems to like the book"
2,Bernie's Tune is worth the price of admission alone!,"I am almost fanatic collector of Clare Fischer.The guy is that good!Sure, you can quibble about which is the best Salsa Picante release - but why bother? Get them all! Or be forever sorry when you can't find them anymore."
2,Excellent Books!,"We bought 2 of these books for our 1 1/2 year old son who LOVES tractors. He now can't go anywhere without them. I just ordered the other 4 to complete the collection since as much as he carries them around and sits quietly (alone) and looks at them, they are sure to be WELL worn in a few months. He is already recognizing the animals and mimicing the animal sounds from looking at the pictures. Our 4 year old daughter (who is HUGE princess fan)loves to climb up in the chair and listen to the stories as well!"
2,Voyager Series: Romantic Hawaii,I ordered this CD for a friend. She listens to it all the time and loves it. Reminds her of when she was stationed in Hawaii with her deceased husband.
1,Not worth it,"This book had a lot of inaccurate information and did not include any gold standards for diagnosis or up to date treatment regimens. It lacked some important diseases and conditions. Layout very basic, probably too basic for most clinicians to use during rotations. Don't spend the money on this, buy the current Griffith 5 minute Clinical Consult instead."
1,El Ventilador,"Despues de ver excelentes producciones como EL CARTEL DE LOS SAPOS y SIN TETAS NO HA PARAISO ,tenia altas expectativas con esta serie EL VENTILADOR...sin embargo...es indiscutible la diferencia.No se si es el guion o las actuaciones..pero simplemente no me gusto."
1,Mediocre,"After seeing other Colombian productions, such as Sin Tetas No Hay Paraiso, El Cartel De Los Sapos, Las Muñecas De La Mafia and other series, this one is not so good, the actors do not make any efort to be convincing. It could bave been better. After the third episode I was loosing interest. The acting was too fake. Christian Tappan did nothing but follow Marlon Moreno. Good actors but bad acting."
1,The toaster has a mind of its own!,"I bought this toaster in February and since then, some days we have toast, some days we don't. Some days the buttons work, some days they don't. You get the idea."
1,This toaster is toast!,"We had this toaster exactly 10 days when the front buttons failed to work. The toaster was not mistreated in anyway, we even unplugged it between uses. JUNK! Not at all what I expected from Consmer Reports Recommeded Buy."
1,Who Wired This Thing?,"This is just a piece of junk. It toasts unevenly and at times hardly at all. The fancy settings (bagel, waffles, etc.) don't mean much, as it doesn't seem to differentiate or be able to figure out just what it is toasting. It also takes a very long time to do what it thinks is the job. Bought this fairly recently and am so unhappy with it that I'm buying another toaster altogether. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,spoilt by a cancerous lesion on page 144,"page 144, 1977 reprint. Picture caption: ""The walnut harvest in the Dordogne in southwestern France. Nuts are beaten from the trees with long poles. There is an ancient saying that walnuts, dogs, and w*m*n are all improved by a good beating from time to time."" yeah he really spelt it ""w*m*n"" with the stars.The book is a tree dictionary + alot of info a gardener might need, like times of year of tree flowering, hardiness maps, etc. So you can probably find that stuff in another book, if you want to, and avoid the ""weirdo factor"" of this book."
2,amazing little camera,"A close friend purchased one of these cameras over a year ago (an older model than mine) and I was instantly amazed at how user friendly it was. My daughter was looking at digital cameras and I suggested the HP which after doing some research she purchased the HP MZ67. After playing around with hers I also bought one! The pictures are clear, it takes wonderful videos, has a nice large veiwing screen and the price is hard to beat. My friend is still using her older model as well with no complaints!"
2,"Love the camera, but disappointed about the company's sale.","The MZ67 Digital Camera that I bought as a gift for my to be husband, was great. He loves it. But one thing , it did not come with the CD and other items that was advertised with it. I emailed the company and also Amazon, and Amazon did the best they could on my behalf. I will not order from that company again. They do not comply with what they advertise and plus in order to use the camera the way you want to use it, the CD comes in very handy. Thank you.Ms. Inez Ann Dill"
1,Dragging Clint Eastwood through literary mud seems to be the author's objective,"I am a big Clint Eastwood fan, starting from a young age (my dad watched Clint's spaghetti westerns). I knew very little about Clint other than his movie characters until watching him being interviewed on ""Inside the Actors Studio"", which I truly enjoyed and would highly recommend. This motivated me to learn more about Clint, which is why I picked up this book. And then put it down and donated it after the first 20 pages. This book reminded me of the grocery store rags you find in the checkout aisle, full of speculation biased on what seems to be a determined effort on the author's behalf to drag Clint in literary mud. This book is so much about what the author thinks of Clint or imagines what might have happened. I'm giving Robert Schnickel's version a try, and while I'm not crazy about the writing style (paragraph-long sentences peppered with preposition phrases), it is undoubtedly a better biography."
2,Incredibly moving and heart-wrenching.,"Anyone remotely interested in adventure, particularly, high-altitude mountaineering, must see this film. First, saw a clip from this movie while watching another documentary called ""Dying for Everest"". Recounts, in vivid and horrible detail, Mike Reinberger's ascent of Everest. Mark Whetu, who was guiding and filming the climb, returned after a night out just below the summit. Reinberger never came down from the summit ridge, despite the Herculean efforts of Whetu. You may recognize Mark Whetu as well as Russell Brice from the series ""Everest: Beyond the Limit"". Those who were critical of Brice or Whetu during the David Sharp tragedy would learn something from watching this film."
1,"Big Tub is Big Fun, but too expensive","I think this a fine learning/play item, but found the exact same thing at Toys R Us for $19.99. I rate the toy as substantially good, but the price is WAY TOO HIGH on this site."
2,Cordless head phones,A number of years ago we purchased a similar item which did not work so well. Not only did we hear the TV but also the local broadcast of a minor league baseball team from a local radio station.We tried again. This product has no interference from radio broadcast and only a very low hiss which can be adjusted to no hiss.No more tripping over cords in the dark. Very satisfied and would rate this as 5 out of 5 stars.jafabussell
2,enjoying different programs,"My husband and I can each watch a different program an still have the door between the patio and the family room open. This product meets our needs. The package arrived a day earlier then I expected and in excellent condition. I am very pleased with the produce, price and service."
1,Extra ears,The extra ears did not work. After charging them all I could hear was static. The ears that came with the transmitter work fine. Had to return them. Have not yet received a refund.
1,wasted my money,I ordered replacement ears after my husbands set just quit working - they did not work. There was nothing but buzzing in the headset. Had 2 other people look at them and nothing.
2,TV Ears second headset,"Once the initial headset/charger was set up, this set works well. Now both my wife and I can set our individual volume control to our own desires. As with the other headset, the tone control does not have adequate high frequency amplification for the elderly with high frequency tone deficiency."
2,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,I actually give this product a 4 star rating over all because the mechanics of it are much to fragile. The ear horse shoe breaks very easily so you have to treat it wuth more than average care. Keep away from kids. Sound quality is superb for voice clearification. The charger is somewhat mickey mouse as it can shift and stop charging the head set.
1,Replacement TV Ears ordered through Amazon Didn't Work - Not Sure Why,"I previously ordered a replacement ""TV Ears"" headset a year or two ago, that worked fine. These, however, do not work (only static). I'm not sure why they don't work & am unfortunately too busy to troubleshoot the issue. In their defense, I have not contacted them to complain or anything. They're probably a good company & my product is either defective or some setting is off that I can't figure out easily."
1,TV Ears Quality,"TV Ears does not hold up well at all, the ear pieces come off all the time and plastic piece foam is attached to broke.This is the third set my husband has had and all are junk.I would not recommend TV Ears to anyone."
1,Would not work!!,I received the TV EARS Replacement set's and they would not work. It sounded like wind blowing when you started them. I don't understand why but they were of no good to me so I returned them.
1,Sounds good but uncomfortable,"Setup for me was easy, I connected the included Digital Audio Cable directly to my DVR cable box and was in business in a matter of minutes. Once the transmitter was pointed in the right direction, the sound coming out of the headsets was clear and the volume was more than adequate. I personally found the headset to be very uncomfortable, the foam inserts on the end of the headset did not help at all and the pressure of the headset became unbearable after a few minutes. Years ago I had purchased a transmitter and receiver that allowed you to plug in any headset you wanted, can no longer find the product but it was great!"
1,Biblical values absent,"If you are a believer in Jesus Christ and seek to glorify God with your life, skip reading Passup Point. I decided against finishing it due to the profanity included and the apparent direction the book was going to take involving the priest in lusting after a minor and then fornication with another woman in the community. God does not consider sin entertaining and therefore I am choosing not to finish this trash for entertainment."
1,Horrible!,"I know that so many of the BS fans would love to believe this is good music, but it is simply bush league."
1,Wow....,"I didn't think it was possible for music to be this bad, but I've been proven wrong. These guys seem to lack a basic knowledge of how to play their instruments, the lyrics are trite, and the vocals of the lead singer make the preverbial ""cat stuck in a blender"" sound like a pleasant audio alternative. Unless you are into sadism stay away from this one, your ears will thank you."
1,Please.....,"one must be brain dead to give this anything more than 1 star. I personally feel sorry for the 690 folks that actually laid out $$$ for this. While the band may have been good live (I dunno), absolutely zero of that translated to disc. Sucks, period."
1,"Been taking for 6 weeks, NOT Flush Free",I've been taking this supplement daily for about 6 weeks now and I can tell you that it is definitely not Flush Free. The dosage might be too high to not cause flushing. I am very good about taking it with plenty of food and yet about 4 hours later the burning and redness really hits me hard. It seems to affect me 5 out of 7 days.The flush is intense and lasts for about 10-15 minutes and then gradually fades away. I'm going to try a different brand and maybe a smaller dosage (2x a day) as it gets pretty annoying. One night while getting ready for bed it was really bad and I had to talk a cold shower. I just want to warn those out there who think there won't be any flushing and to consider this prior to purchase. I was hoping that my body would be used to it by now... guess not.
2,These were easy to take. After a few ...,These were easy to take. After a few days I was feeling more energetic and have been sleeping better too.
1,"Uncontrollable itching, oh god, why","I had previously tried the One a day, Weight smart pills and they made me very sick every time I had one. I asked around, and found it might be the zinc doing it. Or just that type in general. So I decided Id try a similar brand, just without the zinc so I went for the womens formula.Huge mistake. I am itching uncontrollably for more than 24 hours now. I have a rash, bumps, and whats even worse is ive wasted another 15 bucks!Just terrible. Please avoid this whole line of products."
2,Inspiration for fossil hunters,"""Ichthyosaurus and Little Mary Anning,"" by Brooke Hartzog, relates a fascinating story from the history of fossil hunting. The book tells how a young girl named Mary Anning discovered the first whole skeleton of an ichthyosaurus, an extinct species of marine reptile.The book is full of fascinating illustrations of fossils, and of artistic recreations of ichthyosaurs. The only weak element of the book is the fact that the text is often superimposed over the illustrations, thus frequently resulting in text that is difficult to read. Still, this is a visually impressive educational text."
2,I use it all the time,"It does a great job, not only with vegatables, but also with meats like spam and other caned meats, like corned beef."
2,The funniest movie ever,"The movie Oscar is a classi, I used to watch it when I was younger. I've always loved Louis De Funes, he's the funniest man. I truly enjoy his movies because I know I will have a good laugh."
2,"Great Product, timely and accurate shipping...","I'm a huge O.C.C. fan. One of the few viewable shows on TLC, or cable for that matter, but I am a huge fan of the Teutuls dysfunctional family arguments while crafting choppers, and was psyched to find a comfortable fitted hat on amazon. Now I can represent orange county New York with style. Shipping was timely and organized."
2,Good introduction to succession planning,"Especially for the smaller business or the family firm, Wolfe's book provides a concise guide to establishing a succession management strategy. Her writing is free of jargon, and unlike many management books, isn't repetitive or especially boring. I recommend it for anyone contemplating whether a succession management strategy is needed for their business."
1,this is an illegal CD,"we fight against illegal merchandise, and this is one of them.Badly reproduced from the original records.whoever sells illegal records will be subject to a legal action.Please do not buy fraudulent merchandise.Thank you"
2,Awesome,A real fun CD. Full of original arrangements of much loved classics. They really are a world class chorus!
1,Don't waste your time,"Only a few chapters but it was the worst account I have read....it was almost comical and repetitious. A better read is ""23 minutes in hell""."
2,Falling Down into Hell,"I liked reading this short story. Fifteen year-old, Kenneth tells how he died three times and what it felt like when he died. He also describes returning to his body during those three times, apparently from a deformed heart condition. Then he goes on to tell of the fourth time he died and was sucked down into Hell. A scary monster grabbed him by his arm to pull him, like a spider, into his chambers of horror, darkness, and separation from God. He screamed, praying to God as loud as he could. And then a force stronger than the evil monster pulled him up out of the clutches of eternal Hell. Kenneth was rescued because he had prayed a quick version of the sinner's prayer, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Kenneth Hagin went on to live for his Lord, preaching, dying at the ripe old age of eighty-five.An excellent story!!Now I recommend reading:Heaven A Joyful Place"
2,Makes great tasting coffee,"I've had a simple, trusty old Braun 400 for years. When it finally gave out I tried its replacement, the Braun 510 and returned it immediately. It made weak coffee. I moved on to this one. I do not need all the extras (timer, clock, brew strength, etc.) but I decided to try it anyway. I don't like the size and bulkiness of this coffeemaker, but boy does it make a great full-bodied, rich cup of coffee. It's a keeper. Would give it five stars if it were more compact."
1,The Total Money Makeover: A Proven Plan for the Financial Fitness,I am not sure if it was just the digital copy of the book but the content seem disconnected and points were often repeated. Felt like I skimmed through a lot of it hoping it would go into the action items which the book promised.
1,Job Security is NOT Financial Freedom,As a fellow Christian I had high hopes for this one.... Unforunately it's unhelpful. Ramsey does make some valid points but misses the big picture. He teaches you to conform to job security rather that to break through and strive for financial freedom. If you want real financial education I recommend Robert Kiyosaki.
2,Smart book,Guided me in ways to handle money for my future and ways to invest it now. It also covers how to use your money so it works for you and not for others.
2,The Total Money Makeover,Alot of good information on getting us on track. Would recommend for all households - deeply in debt or behind on saving for retirement. The budget form really showed us where our cash flow was going - out of our pockets and on unnecessary expenses. Seeing positive feedback in my marriage as well.
2,GO GAZELLE GO!!!,"I found Dave's advice logical, inspirational, entertaining and straight to the point. Dave definitely didn't disappoint. I can't wait to put his advice into action so that I too can scream out ""I'M DEBT FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
1,Don't buy the Kindle version,"If you must be told to get out of debt and save and invest, get the print version.Mostly it's full of testimonials so, if you need the ""if they can do it so can you"" encouragement, here it is!The publisher obviously thinks that NO effort needs to go into reformatting a print book for Kindle.The entire last 20% is forms which can't be printed from a Kindle.While reading along you'll get ramdom quotes that are from other parts of the book.You've been warned (it's not like they're the only ones that have a Kindle formatting problem so beware)."
2,Dave Ramsey Rocks!!!,"If you want to get and stay out of debt..Dave Ramsey's Plan Works!!!we are on babystep 4...starting on step 6 in June,2011..Follow the plan and you too will ""Live like no one else""..We have no bills, no car payments, just our house under 70,000 and counting down quickly....It is a Life changing plan..Don't hesitate..get this book..He is also on radio(daveramsey.com), and facebook..UPDATE: Feb.9/2013Ok..Mission Accomplished!! We Paid our house off in November 2012!!!!!!!!!!! we have Zero Debt!!!!!!!!!!!! Zilch, Nada!! FINANCIAL FREEDOM has rung!!!!!!!! Thanks to Dave Ramsey and his teaching. We still live like we are on a Budget, Cash flow everything, never again to borrow money. No Need.. This is a very humbling experience, what have you got to lose??all the best to you!"
2,"Changed, our, and our families lives","If you allow this book, to change your paradigm, you will become a wealthy person. My wife & I, have good incomes, so good, by fours years out of school, we had $125,000 of NON Mortgage, debt. I had heard Dave some on the radio, so when I saw the book, I told my wife, jokingly, that this book was going to make us a lot of money. By early next year, after a lot of sacrifice, determination and following the principles in the book, we'll be debt free, we'll never borrow money again. We will literally begin to change our entire family tree, all thanks to a $20 hardback..."
2,One of the best books ever written,"If you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, buy this book. Dave's step by step method for beating debt and building wealth absolutely works. It's changed my life immensly."
2,A Life Changer,"I would recommend this to anyone I know. I'm just starting to employ the principles and ideas from the book and just starting the baby steps but I already feel better about my knowledge level and money situation. Read it, apply it, and you'll change your whole life. On my way to DEBT FREE!!!"
1,Athletic Training Student,"Although this book was relatively thorough, it was very boring to read. I dreaded having to read the thing even though the subject matter was interesting to me. The few pictures in the book were old and were not helpful. This book is not good for any type of visual learner. If you are a professor looking for a good text for an injury assessment class, keep looking!"
2,an entertaining easy read....,"I enjoyed this book. The dialog/verbal sparring between the two characters was great. The princess held her own in a variety of interesting circumstances. The story wrapped up a bit too neatly but left several items unsolved. Her character was strong, his a bit soft. The bodyguard Burr was most enjoyable. I've not read too many ""pirate"" novels but i enjoyed this."
2,Fantastic gear bag,Zune Gear BagThis is a great gear bag there is a place for everthing. It doesn't matter if you have a Zune it would work on just about any MP3 player. I have a Zune 120 and even in its leather kick case it still fits in the gear bag. All the adaptors fit & there's a partition between the player & the adaptors so they wont scatch your player. I highly recommend it. I've already purchased 5 and plan to purchase 3 more! Happy shopping.
2,Got to Have a Zune Gear Bag,"Anyone with a Zune would really benefit from having this bag. It is perfect for packing it to carry along WITH it's accessories. It has a 'fitted' place for the Zune itself with other compartments for headphones, and any other necessities you want."
2,Nice Case,A very nice hard case. Has plenty of room for any accessory you want to take with you. Fits easily into an average sized bag. I use it everyday to take my Zune to work.
1,Just not the same!,"I purchased this thinking it was the women from the PBS special. It wasn't, and it wasn't nearly as good. The singing had no emotion and the song selection wasn't that great. Skip and buy the real thing with Meav, Lisa, Chloe, et al. I gave this one and Celtic Woman, Vol. 1 away."
1,Not helpful to me,"The content was very simplistic - I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Also, the book is rife with typos and grammatical errors. That made me question the book's credibility; especially considering the topic is book publishing."
1,Since Thornton Publishing is so well known....,"...in the publishing industry, the veracity of this book speaks for itself."
1,Not worth the hassle,"This is the most frustrating DVD player I've ever owned. When it works, it's fine, but . . .Remote is badly designed, you need a light on to use the thing. The pause button is buried between the repeat button and the fluorescent dimmer. Why?I can deal with the remote. The biggest problem is that it is very slow to recognize discs if it does so at all. If the disc is not pristine and dust free, it skips or simply doesn't recognize at all. I don't even bother with it using the kids CDs anymore, too frustrating.My $39 Apex is far more reliable.Update 2/2006:Player totally failed 1/2006. I swore at the time to never buy another Toshiba product. But . . .I called Toshiba Customer Support and they sent me a new player (SD-6980) which so far is fantastic (and adds new features as well):- Good remote- Reads most any disc- Flash card reader- DIVX support"
1,Breaks easily,This is the second Toshiba DVD player I've owned. The first broke after 2 years. This one broke in less than 1 year. If you are even considering purchasing a Toshiba I would strongly suggest getting an extended warranty as they break quickly.
1,Do not buy this.,DO NOT BUY!I concur with all the bad reviews:- Open/Close takes 5 tries- Remote stinks- Went bad after 6 months - cannot load brand new disks- Only 90 Day WarrantyVery dissapointed - I feel scammed
1,Extremely disappointing!,"I agree with the previous negative reviews: a low-quality, poorly designed product... sluggish controls, useless remote, awkward interface and.... mine died after 6 months!"
1,Fell apart within 5 weeks,"The good reviews got me to buy this - I have a plasma, so I wanted to HDMI upconversion. Unfortunatley this thing has many problems. BUYER BEWARE!1. It's remote is laid out very poorly, nothing is easy to find on it.2. It comes on very slowly, sometimes, just to get the tray to open, it takes 3 or 4 trys.3. It SKIPS! No, it's not my DVD, I have another and tested the same section of the movie and it didn't. The player just froze, like a slow computer when it has too much to handle.I am returning this item today, luckily BestBuy had an extended return policy during the holiday. You may not be so luckily. I do NOT suggest this product unfortunatley."
1,Don't buy,"Takes too long to load the DVD. If there is even a small blemish on the DVD, it has trouble playing it. The remote is very limited."
1,false advertising,"This educational dvd was advertised as compatible with both Windows and Mac. I don't know about Windows, but it is not compatible with Mac OS. It is worthless to me, after having purchased it."
2,Color lasts,The best of several hunter orange collars that I have purchased. The color lasted about three years before fading. Very flexible plastic-type material did not wear at all in that amount of time.
1,Littest Angel & Cosmic Christmas,"Video tape arrived as advertised, in original packaging. But quality was sub-standard. Was recorded in LP, so visuals not crisp. Audio was fuzzy, especially voices. Visuals had a dark tint."
1,Boo,"We bought 2 of these so me and my 10 year old daughter could play together. We both agreed that this game made no sense, had no instructions as far as what to do or where to go. You control your character by using the a w s and d keys. It was as though the creator had many ideas and never sorted any of them out. Save your money, buy Evergirl or or even Dreamlife plug and play."
1,"okay, but not awesome","I like the idea that the pillow will never get wear out, because you just add more water. But with that being said I would like to be able to add MORE water so the pillow is firmer."
1,"Expensive, Flat, and Uncomfortable - Save your money","Pros:- Soft- Somewhat easy to fill with water- Nice coverCons:- Too expensive- Too flat (less than 4 inches thick even when filled with 100oz water)- Did NOT ease my neck pain, but in fact made it worse- Could not feel any ""Down Plus"" difference"
2,Your all in one Gardening & Farming magazine,"I wish I had known about this magazine years ago, love it. FULL of helpful information if you garden or farm. I learn many things with each new issue and look forward to receiving them. Very helpful articles, tips and stories to help you make the most our of your land, gardening, farming and producing. Will certainly re-subscribe every year."
1,Misleading and Mediocre,"Only two labels, not 20. Also, the package says there's an ""enclosed jewel case"" which there is not. Finally, the software doesn't do anything unique or valuable that isn't available better and/or better value elsewhere. In short, not a product to be bothered with."
2,It could be better......,"It's worth having as it is but it's not the classic that it might have been. A hardcover edition with the prayers in Hebrew with transliteration, as well as the fine English translation contained in this book, would have been made this book a classic. To my knowledge the book I describe does not exist but it should. We need it! Publishers take note!"
1,The Frugal Gourmet on the Polish Kitchen,"Decent, but not fancy. His later effort in The Frugal Gourmet On our Immigrant Ancestors has much more authentic recipes. Still, the video demonstration of how to cook and fill pierogi will help those who have not seen these done. I tried the Pot Roast with Dill and found it to be very good. His recipe for the kielbasa filling is good, but later recipes are better. Bottom line: Look for videos from the Immigrant Ancestor series or get that book."
2,Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 On line,"Great book for the beginners. If you want to get hands-on experience, this is the one. You'll get some help with the problems by posting them in the discussions online, and other students will reply if they want, or you can look at the past discussions and responses that are helpful to you. One thing that needs authors' attention is that they should compile and create a Frequenly Asked Questions file and put its icon in in a corner of discussion panel, so the students don't have ask the similar questions over and over again."
1,teasing gay fantasy,Never have I seen so many gay short stories performed w/o any hint of sex and hardly any kissing. Pure fantasy.
1,Case of the Missing Cutthroat,The book Case Of the Missing Cutthroat is the worst book I have ever read. There is no point in the story. me and my friends joke about suffering from the Jean Craighead George disease. By the way don't read this book.
2,Love is Always 17,"I have finally found this cd after months of searching for it. I saw David Gates in concert a few years back in New Zealand and I thought he was fantastic. One song that really stood out to me was 'love is always seventeen' and since then I have been trying really hard to find that song. Thank goodness for the internet!Anyway, I think this is one of the most beautiful songs that David has ever sung and I hope he continues to release more solo albums."
2,learn to set and clean-up,"we set the table, clean-up, pretend wash the table.Match color plates and cups.practice cutting.great toy for dramatic play and counting and recognizing colors."
2,Play dishes,"Overall, the dishes will be an excellent teaching tool for counting, colors, mix and match. We will include table manners. The plates are too small. Difficult to hold much play food on them."
2,The Rest of the Reviews Aren't Lyin',"The blue-cover version of this album *IS* in fact better, as it included such classics as ""Beat Box"", ""Moments in Love"" and ""Close (to the Edit)"". However, these songs were licensed from ZTT/Island, and I guess something went wrong. So on this re-release we get tracks from ""Below the Waste"" and ""FON Mixes"" to take their place. Not a bad collection, but not what it was."
2,WARNING: 16-BIT software NOT compatible with Windows 7 64-bit PC,"I was excited to start playing this game as I was a big fan of the X-wing game back in the day. Wish LucasArts would produce another great simulator, but I settled for the ""best of the old"".Surprise surprise, 16-bit software programs are no longer supported by the newer versions of Windows without upgrading to Windows7 professional, buying an emulator and making a number of other modifications. Well - I'd love to play the game, but not for another couple hundred bucks. Especially when it would be the only software I'd ever need to use that on.I'm sure the seller will be gracious enough to allow my return."
2,Understand this is the best.,"Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat is The Juliana Theorys best cd. I love the previous cds, but the song structure has been perfected and they have kept the sound that makes them different from the many clones. The whole cd is something that I can listen to with out skipping a song. It has been awhile since there has been a cd I actually get excited to hear."
2,Simply rocks,"This is a wonderful album and well worth your time and money! A must have for rock fans and a great supplement to the Juliana Theory's other albums. For those looking for solid, driving rock, catchy melodies, quality vocals, and meaningful lyrics, the Juliana Theory delivers. Plus, there's the bonus DVD footage where you get to learn a little about the band."
2,This is a very good album.....,"For people who like rock albums, check this album out. Now, I'm not a big fan of emo at all, so if there's anybody out there that thinks this band is just emo they would be wrong. If it was emo I wouldn't be listening to it. I only gave the cd 4 stars because there's a couple songs on the album I didn't like. They started to sound like every other band in this genre. But the majority of the songs rock. Although, most if not every song sounds like its about breaking up with a girlfriend and saying so long to her. Which is fine. I'm sure if I was the writer for a band it that just happened to me it would show through. Anywho, really good album. Definitly worth the cash."
1,Broken for the start,"When I opened the trimmer, one of the attachments broke when I attempted to remove the cover...If I can't return it to Amazon, I will throw it into my garbage."
2,Very acccurate,"I can't speak for most of this book on the numbers but the boats I have been on were dead accurate on speed, weapons, TD and SHP (all boats of those classes are razor blades now so it doesn't really matter). I'd say that a lot of the other information is close, if not dead nuts, on the attributes of many of the other classes based upon sea stories that I've heard from my prior shipmates.If you want to learn about the modern US submarine force's history this is a good place to start.The only negative I can find is that it stops at the development of the Seawolf (SSN-21 class) so it is a bit outdated. However it gives a good insight on the process the U.S. used to develop its submarine programs."
2,Good and fast in operation,"The flash drive is fast in copying files and data. I had tried with big files, and it seems to be pretty fast and its unique design of gripping makes it easy to handle and install to a USB port."
2,great book series with collectible magnets,"This is a wonderful new book for your poke-loving children. There are pokemon to colour, matching pokemon to find and many more activities. The sides are perforated, so you even can put them on the wall after finshing your favourite one. But the best thing is: There are two collectible magnets attached to each book of this new series! Your children will love this book!"
1,"Excellent movies, disappointing extras","PROS:Extended versions of the theatrical releases provided very useful background information. Fantastic audio and visual transfer.CONS:Each movie requires 2 discs. This is understandable given the additional footage, but was slightly irritating. The bonus discs are all region coded, despite the product claiming to be ""region free"". No good on my Australian DVD players (PS3 and Panasonic Blu Ray player).VERDICT:Those wanting to see the extended movie versions will be in for a treat. Those wanting to see the extras on B/2 region players will be disappointed. Would have been value for money had the set worked as claimed."
1,2 discs per film still?,"Surely one disc for all 3 films unexextended should be included, or at least one disc per extended. Changing out discs is lame and for PS2 games only.I'll wait until the inevitable third BR release, with each extended version on one film alone.A hundred bucks for too many things and lame digital copies is way too much. Digital copies just clutter up dvd boxes, and there's no way you can enjoy them when your laptop needs to be plugged in due to low battery life, or on a tiny tiny ipod screen, but it's a format that's here to stay and eat up disc box space (It wouldn't be quite so bad if it was just a voucher slip like some films include).Anyway, anyone can do without disc overexertion when another release'll be around that corner."
2,2012 :(,Sad that we have to go through the whole Theatrical release following by the only version that anyone cares about (Extended edition). With that being said.. I went ahead and voted the theatrical version a 1 and this a 5 like most of the fans out there!
1,Why The Green Tint?,"The extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring on Blu-ray has a green color shift across the entire movie. I believe the studio made an error in mastering this movie. The snow looks teal/green, even the lettering of the title no longer looks as white. This isn't the Matrix and the colors were great to begin with, so why mess it all up? I loaded screenshots into photoshop just to verify the colors had been changed, and sure enough the snow scenes are reading much higher in the green channel as opposed to previous releases of the movie. The other two movies don't suffer from this ""green shift"" so I urge others to complain, not buy, return their copies until WB issues a trade-in for a properly mastered disk!"
2,Completely Worth It!!!!!,I gave this trilogy 5-stars the moment I saw the price! These three have always been one of my favorites movies and I never get tired of seeing them.The extended scenes and the ones that where added are also a huge part of why this set is awesome! 5 CD's in each case with hours and hours of detailed information. Behind the scenes and the stories and background of the important characters and creatures of Middle-Earth.Simply AWESOME!
2,muy bueno,"totalmente nuevo, viene en una caja muy útil para guardar las películas, excelente calidad de vídeo, y es versión extendida."
2,THIS is the one that should have been available from the get go,"Please people. Don't waste your money on the theatrical version, buy the one with the most content instead! Stop movie studios from milking us of our hard earned money!"
2,Satisfied with product...but prepare for disc changes,"Overall the product looks fantastic. The cover display, the case, the picture quality, all are great. Just be prepared for multiple Blu Ray discs for individual films. This seems to be the only drawback that I've found. I would recommend this product."
2,My money goes to the best edition,"I bought the Lord of the Rings on DVD two times. After watching the extended edition on DVD, I cannot watch the regular movie edition again. I will buy this the day it comes out."
1,"Holding off, defective product","So I had to wonder why the selling price was basically half off and I now know why. One of the films was obviously messed up before being transferred to disc. The problem is a green tint to the movie so everything, teeth, snow, sky look green.Some have said this was the Directors intentions, other say adjust your TV set. I say BS to those idiots. The other versions didn't have the problem and I've watched stuff from the 1940's to the present without ever having to adjust the TV. Your TV is NOT the problem!And to the trolls saying this isn't the right place to give a 1 star to the product because it's a blah blah this issue (shipping, amazon customer service, or whatever); go take a hike. No one cares!If you were unfortunate enough to have purchased this set and your copy has a problem then return it or do a credit card chargeback dispute. And where the heck is Amazon in all this?!? They should be emailing everyone and returning this junk to the manufacturing facility!"
1,Blu-Ray Extended requires flipping the disc,"It is still way too early, but the editorial review above already states that the discs will contain both theatrical and extended on the same disc and that you will still have to flip the disc over mid-way through the movie regardless of the version you're watching.This is absurd, and I would tell everyone to wait until it is closer to a release date for more accurate information. I highly doubt they will make a Blu-Ray that is double sided and split the movies in 1/2 for each side. I can, however, see one side the extended and the other the theatrical version.It's just too early to make predictions though, so anyone trying to state that they know what's going to happen are idiots and should be ignored."
1,"I Agree, Shame is an understatement","This is beyond sad, What will the movie companies do when we're broke from buying 15 copies of the same movie??? I LOVE THE MOVIES DON'T GET ME WRONG. But I promised never to pay full price for ""transformers"" because Paramount thought they were doing us a service by charging 30.00 for the blu-ray a year later after they sold out to HD-DVD, and I haven't. Same with ""Lord of the Rings"", I've had 3 versions and I'll wait for this to be previously used for about 40.00 or so. $105.00, please. You have no respect for us, why should we respect you??????"
1,An open letter to New Line: Re. 2011 or 2012,"While the LOTR trilogy is some of my favorite film of all-time, waiting until 2011 or 2012 to release the extended edition is a flat-out insult.You won't catch me buying the theatrical release in the meantime, New Line. No matter how long you leave it out there as the only option.If this is how you do business, you won't be selling me much at all. 2011 or 2012 gives me lots of time to rethink my blind faith to this franchise.Now the movies, extended cut, would get a 4.5 star rating and a purchase order - if they were out today. 2011 or 2012? A ""0"" if I could choose it. Timing is everything, after all."
1,"Really dissapointing, they have no shame....","It's amazing, the little to no shame they must have, not only to NOT release the extended version together with the theatrical ones, but also to post their little sign saying ""hey, we're not putting this out for another year or two, so if you want hi def, buy the other crap we just put out""...Total rip-off, crooks.. LEt's boycott the theatrical release!"
2,Love it,Have enjoyed this Triology so very much. The added scenes make this Triology.Would recommend this for anyone that has purchased the original.
1,a desapointment from the beginning,"I'm a fan of the trilogy Lord of the rings and too long I waited to buy it on blu ray, I live in Chile so I ordered fast delivery which never happened it took almost a month and a half to reach my country (i-parcel fault)when I opened it I thought it was worth the wait, but soon my hopes were dashed, the case where all disks are packed is nice had a nice pic, but immediately began to peel, the littles books that come inside the disc box come all ""dog-eared"", and the worst is that the disc of bonus material from the community ""jumps"" constantly, and i'm affraid to put other disc, a total disappointment ..."
1,"LOTR EE BR skips, freezes & won't load","I'm having trouble w LOTR EE BR playing in my Samsung HT-B6930W system ...they played ok back when I got them last Fall ...now they skip and freeze about an hour in; after that I get a disc specification error and discs won't load.Samsung has not been helpful. I've turned off the BdLive feature (it is not hooked up to the Internet anyway); I've updated to latest firmware; I've done a power reset; and I've even tried setting the memory to an external 8Gb USB; however, each time I've done something new, it will load and play any given disc for about an hour/chap14 then starts skipping and freezing until it eventually freezes permanently...after that any reload attempt is met w disc specification error for any of the 3 movie discs."
1,Dispaointed,"i dont know what New Line Was thinking when they released this version . For one 15 disc really , thats a waste of space . We are in the Blu Ray age , 6 discs for 3 movies come on . I wanted one movie on one disc , if all the appendices are on the bonus disc why waste all that space . Im going to stick with the dvd version of these movies till they can think straight ."
1,Green Goblin? Green Lantern? Green Hornet? No: LoTR: TFotR !!,"Too green. Too bad. I'll keep the EE DVD for the 1st one, thank you very much Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema, or whoever's responsible. Has to be a mistake somewhere ..."
1,Poor Business,"I originally had this at 5/5 stars. But I'm changing my answer as a thumbs down to new line and its cohorts. This is so intollerable for me that I will not be attending the Hobbit when it comes out to film. what's the point. See the film, then salivate to buy it, only then to have them yank me around for its extended version. Better to not have seen the Hobbit, than to have to go through this b.s. again."
1,Not a review of the movie,"This has a nice box. But I was pretty sure that blu-rays were supposed to be these huge data holding disks right? Then why are these movies still split up over 2 disks each? I understand that high quality means more space, but seriously, why did I even upgrade from the DVD version?"
2,Ultimate Edition?,"I will keep this short and sweet. The sound and picture quality are as good as you can possibly want. One complaint, and in my opinion it is a big one, the movies are still broken up onto two discs. With all the storage capacity of Blu-ray I should not have to change discs the same way as I did with the DVD version. That is the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star rating."
2,Good movies even better,"The extended version has made for a richer experience, I would recommend it to all Lord of the Rings fans,"
1,"silly, a huge disappointment","This trilogy of movies took one of the greatest works of literature and turned it into a silly action adventure romp. Though it wouldn't have been possible to convey the depth and intricacy of the books in a movie, still, nothing of real value was retained in translation, and that was surely avoidable.Most of the major characters are so distorted or simplified that they become ridiculous. The story is also gutted, and the movies become empty formula films. Do yourself a favor and read the books. Peter Jackson seemingly did, but still apparently doesn't have a clue. Tolkien, a deeply spiritual man who certainly intended more for his major work, must be rolling over in his grave."
2,"Great set, almost everything I wanted","Of course this set is going to be amazing, the extended editions are the only way to really watch these movies, and in blu-ray they look fantastic. My only complaint is that they split the movies in half (like on the DVDs) so if you were to watch the entire movie, you have to get up and switch to the second disc. Not too big of a complaint, I was just hoping, because it's on blu-ray, they'd figure out a way to fit the entire movie on a single disc. Other than that, if you're a Lord of the Rings fan and don't own them yet on blu-ray, pick it up, especially if you've never seen the extended editions."
1,I have to send it back,"In the description there were Polish subtitles mentioned and this was the main reason for choosing an edition as well as a low-price offer (adding freight and customs duties it was stil cheaper than the similar version offered in Poland).Unfortunately I got a version with English, Spanish and Portugeese subtitles.As I checked after the delivery suddenly the description on the website was changed,From the very beginning there was also no info that Dvds are not readible in Europe.Blu-ray discs were working in my Blu-ray Panasonic player.The edition was perfect and beatiful, what's a pitty the offer was misleading."
2,Great Product,thank you it is the perfect gift Excellent quality and great priceHave not viewed it...but sure the blue ray way will be great..
2,Just what I expected,Pros:- The movie itself is an advantage.- Incredible image (when having an appropiate TV). I've seen the movies lots of times and now I'm noticing lots of new details.- Nice package and extras.Cons:- When I received it the box was kind of bent on the corners and the inside of every movie was broken (the plastic boxes) but not serious.- The extensive amount of DVD's with extras I already had. They should have made them into Blu-ray.- The Digital copy will be more or less useless if you live outside the US or Canada since you can't download it on iPod format.
2,Great collection,"I recently watched the movies on DVD and decided to buy the bluray set. It's amazing, has everything you want and more, if you liked the previous versions by this right now!!!"
1,Sadly disappointing,"Having read so many of Gwendoline Butler's 'John Coffin' series, I was eagerly anticipating a great read. Unfortunately, the book does not deliver. Gratuitous grisly imagery, and a great deal of self-absorped (and questionable) sentimentality on the part of Coffin - used to poor effect because the resulting text never makes you connect with the characters in this mystery. Not a recommended read for those who have not been introduced to Coffin's appealing detection in other works by Butler."
2,They DO stack,"I just received my baskets and they are great. I use them in my kitchen drawers and because they are mesh, tiny crumbs fall out the bottom of the tray and I just wipe the drawer clean. Easy peasy. The baskets do indeed stack, but you have to have the same width baskets to do so (duh). And if you want the stacked baskets to slide overtop, then the length of basket on top obviously needs to be smaller. Highly recommend these baskets for drawer organization."
2,"Unique, Harmonious, Uplifting","Sawyer's view of the world may be a little starry- eyed, but his implementation is flawless. This album should be in everyone's collection. I never leave on a long trip without a copy on tape. The world influence is evident. The pure skill at arrangement in ""I Know"" and ""Spoken Word"" is impressive. The voices virtually double as instruments."
1,Let Down,"I was very excited to finally get my tetris in the mail... ""Don't count your chickens before they hatch"" as they say though. There was nothing really exciting about the game. It was overall bland (no good tunes like previous versions, and boring animations). My biggest beef with the game is with the multiplayer. On N64 my favorite part of the game was playing multiplayer with my wife (especially since it is the only time she will actually play a video game). The problem is that you need a magnifying to see your game boards. Neither of us could even see what we were doing. BAD MULTIPLAYER AND BLAND."
1,How could someone screw up Tetris?,"We loved Tetris in all of its forms, especially the N64 version. However, this game was a BIG disappointment. No longer can you play head to head with someone until one of you builds up enough blocks to ""die"", instead you can only play as long as you want in story mode, which is one player. In the multiplayer mode, you can't play a long, involved game against someone. Instead, you play a game that has a time limit, and goals. This would be ok if you could turn the time limit on and off, and if you could manually adjust the goals. Since you can do neither, this [is bad].My fiance asked how could someone [mess] up Tetris, and this is the answer, this game. The N64 version is a much better game.This game is only good if you are someone who likes short little games in multiplayer. If you happened to like 45 minute challenges between people, then you're [out of luck]."
2,Great Bluegrass Instrumentals!,If you love Shania and bluegrass then this is a must have!You won't regret it!
1,Unless you're looking for a TOY - don't waste your $!!,"So, look at the DETAILS: what comes in a 1""x2"" box can't hold much, especially for a book. This would be appropriate for 10 year-olds, but if you're looking for something informative, look elsewhere. Not even worth the money. Not even worth returning."
1,Soap Box Rambling,This is a heart-felt testimony pointing to the valid argument that Castro misled many in consolidating his July 26 movement. I just wish that Heres' memoir was not suffused with his anti-Castro rhetoric which borders on reaction. His story is gripping enough without having to get almost sermonic with it.
1,Bad Description,"Don't buy this book if you think it contains any knowledge to help you pass the CPA exam. The description states that the book will give the reader ""real world intelligence, strategies and experience from industry experts to prepare you for everything the classroom and textbooks won't teach you."" The only thing this book talks about is how the CPA exam requirements have changed and how the profession is changing. You could learn more by going to the AICPA website and spending 2 minutes there. The book will literally take the average reader about 15 minutes to read because it's so small and has large print. There is absolutely nothing useful that can be applied toward the CPA exam. This is probably the worst purchase I have made on amazon.com - don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas from one of the vendors on December 16th 06. Didn't get the merchandise and found that the order was mailed back to the company because I used a PO Box. I had to call to find this out. If they can't ship to PO Boxes using their carrier why did they ship it out in the first place. I wonder if I had not called, would they have credited my card back at all? When I called, the company was friendly and responsive and mailed the product out again, but, I didn't receive it until January 5th 07. The product was defective, we had to push the battery up in the casing before the remote would work. Once we did that it worked nicely,but, for the money I don't feel I should have to hold the battery in place. It was hard to control also. I won't buy this product again."
1,Got to use it three times. No customer service.,"The three times I used it the machine was good, except it didn't get all the flour, etc. from the corners. Using a spatula helped with that. Today i made a loaf of bread and wanted to make a second loaf. It's been unplugged and cooling off for three hours and it won't let me program it. I just bought a different machine. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Money and time saver,"I received this machine well over a week ago and have made a couple of loaves and love it! It has made some delicious bread and is so easy, I am kicking myself for not buying this sooner! I bought bread flour and yeast in bulk and when we're almost out of bread, just pop in the ingredients and let the machine do the work. It's super easy to follow and will save time and money for sure.I have already recommended this machine to my friends and family and they're listening and purchasing!"
1,After one year,"I bought mine last March and have been making a loaf of bread just about every week. Today it made its last loaf, the motor was straining to turn the paddle.Positive: The price.Negatives: LCD is next to impossible to read. Made to be viewed by someone under 5' tall, I over 6'. Bread crust is over-cooked, even on the light setting. It never wanted to make a great loaf of bread, no matter how hard I tried. To load the pan I had too pull the machine out from under the cabinet and turn it so the lid would open wide enough for the pan.I'm tired of messing with this machine. I have 3 weeks left on the one year warranty, and won't waste my money shipping it back. My previous machine cost $180, but it lasted 7 years. This one was $40, and lasted one year. Add me to the never again group on Sunbeam bread machines."
1,It's a machine that is worth only 40+ dollars....,It looked ok when it first arrived...but after you used it. You will never find the right way to make the good bread...!! I don't think I will consider the same brand again.
1,sunbeam 5891 2# programmable breadmaker,The appliance is bulky. The french bread I tried came out small and condensed.I should not have given away my old magic chef one that still worked very well after 8 years...Sorry I bought the sunbeam!
1,Something Loose Inside !,"I received the breadmaker, and when I was taking it out of the box, I noticed something rattling inside the bread maker. I noticed that there was a Chinese ""QC Passed"" sticker on the bottom of the machine. Great job guys.I tried to take the bottom off the breadmaker, but it won't come off. I guess that I will have to leave the loose screw or whatever it is , inside until it shorts out the electrical components. It's not worth the $15.00 shipping to return it for a new one. I was hoping for a little better quality for a $60.00 BREAD MACHINE !"
1,High defective assembly rate,"I ordered 2 units for Christmas presents. One unit had a screw loose inside - was 1 of 3 screws holding the power/mixer drive unit in place and was in a position such that I could not get the screw back into its hole, so I sent it back. Then later I got news on 2nd unit.Its delayed start button fell to inside of control panel (probabaly missing the part behind it that holds it in place?) on the very first press of the button. I had already replaced the 1st defective unit with another one when I learned of the defective button. After testing all its buttons, so far it seems to be OK, no loose screws or buttons, but not much time has passed since X-mas to be sure how it will hold up. The 2nd defective unit will be replaced with a different brand. But it does make good bread when you have a fully functional unit. Too bad the assembly quality is so poor. Thank you Amazon for taking back the defective units no problem!"
1,Too Much Heat,"I have experience with two Sunbeam bread machines. The model 5895 and 5891. The 5895 is no longer inproduction. However, the 5895 is far and away a better machine. The two 5891 units I have experience with both have had heat control problems. The newest one has to be run on the ""light"" setting as the other two settings make the bread too dark. However, I will say that the non stick coating on the tub of the 5891 is much better than that on the 5895.In addition, it seems almost impossible to see and read the display without a flashlight on the 5891. I suspect the microprogram chip on the 5891 has a software problem controlling the heat ranges. Further, I don't appreciate the fact that the price has been reduced by $10.00 since I place my order less than 30 days ago."
2,Love it!,"I love my bread machine. I've used it a few times & love it. It so easy. All u do is put the ingredients in the order the manual states punch put in the setting then walk away. The machine does the hard part for you. How much easier can it get? I gave it 4 stars because the machine is a lot bigger than I thought & the bread loaf is in a weird shape, not "" store"" size."
2,Not the greatest but good for the price.,"For the cost of this bread machine I would recommend it. If you do not mind paying a higher price I suggest getting another machine since the results in this machine are not always the best, but will do for the price."
2,"Great price, Great Value","I received this machine from Amazon 4 weeks ago. I made a loaf first day I received it, with the receipe on the manual and used the delay programm. The loaf was so so. Then I searched some other receipes over the internet. Now I use the machine for dough making only, and bake in the oven. I got a few great loafs so far and I love baking now. Over all, it's a good machine for the price I paid, $32.55, easy to use and clean. The size is quite big, so be aware. Don't get disapointed if you failed the first few loafs. There are some techniques that you need to learn to make a perfect loaf."
2,the best,This is my third bread machine and I think it is the best. It is my first Sunbeam bread machine. The recipe for whole wheat bread that came with the machine is the best wheat bread I have ever had in my 61 years! I would recommend this machine to anyone....
2,Great machine,"This is a neat little machine, mess free, measure all your stuff in, plug it in, set, that's it and it works very well. After some trial and error, I got it now. Ordered Monday afternoon, UPS was here Wednesday afternoon, I love Amazon and UPS, free shipping, great price. Turn your lights on, put your glasses on and you can see the direction panel.UPDATE: Forget customer service, I lost the paddle, messing with Sunbeam, backordered, they cut me off today about this. Ordered from a place online called Nelson, cost me $20.00, machine cost $45.00 when I bought it. Don't lose your paddle.Still looking for a great recipe book. Great buy for $45.00, quiet, takes up some space, easy to clean and works great."
2,Worth the Wait!,"I am so glad I waited until now to buy a Bread Maker. Having shopped many times on Amazon, I knew this was the right place to go to to buy one. But which one? I read many, many reviews for a lot of machines on Amazon, and I was thoroughly convinced that the SUNBEAM 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker was the one for me!! I used several different recipes for bread and each one turned out PERFECT! And it is SO EASY. 5***** I would highly recommend it."
2,A Great Bread Machine,"This Sunbeam 5891 bread machine has served very well.The usage of the correct flour types makes a major difference; expect that you will have to experiment with recipes for best results.In comparison to using a coventional oven, the power consumption and release of heat is remarkably better especially on warm summer days.The machine is easy to use and includes all needed features. It is also a very good value!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I was not able to even try my new Sunbeam Breadmaker (model 5891) because neither I nor my strong husband could yank out the bread pan. It was inserted in a very crooked way by the manufacturer. While attempting to remove the pan, I noticed that its wire handle was very thin and flimsy, indicating poor design, and this part certainly needs to be very sturdy. I am familiar with my daughter's breadmaker made by Toastmaster and it is much superior to this Sunbeam model."
2,Best bread machine in its class,"After doing much research on bread machines and narrowing down the choices by price range and feature, the Sunbeam was the best bread machine in its class. I have baked many loaves of different breads in the three months I've owned it and the interface is simple and easy to use. I loved the bread machine so much that I got one for my mom for her birthday and she loves it!"
1,It broke after 3 months,"This was our first bread maker. Its a vertical bread maker. the heat was not evenly distributed when baking the bread. It did make decent bread. The belt broke after 3 months. Send it bake to Sunbeam and waiting for a replacement or the fix. not a durable product, spend more and get a better product"
2,Does what it supposed to,"Purchased this breadmaker about a month ago, made some bread (about 4 loaves) and pizza dough. The machine worked as advertised, i.e. it made bread and dough. Some vibration present during kneading, but that is expected, I like the fact that the pan is locked at the bottom and not by two flimsy tabs on the sides as some other machines are, less things to break later. The first loaf of bread fell but the subsequent loaves came out looking great, the trick here is to use bread flour instead of plain white, I think. The pizza dough came out really good. I would recomend this machine to people who don't do fancy breadmaking but make about 1 or 2 loaves a week. It is 1/4 of the price of the fancier machines and does the job that it is made to do.Gave it 4 stars because I only had it for short period of time. Don't know how well it will work after a year yet."
2,breadmachine gift,I brought this item as a gift. I picked the this product based on reviews and price and so far the person loves it.
2,breadmaker,I recently purchased the Sunbeam breadmaker model 5891. Have used it to make bread and dough. It has worked very well. The instruction book that came with it is poorly written. The customer service was great.
1,"Horrible, overdone, uneven bread. Don't buy this!","I purchased this to replace a breadmaker that was getting old. I am very disappointed! On the LIGHT setting, the bread is overdone - with a very dark and hard crust. It does not mix the ingredients well, as there are bits of dough and loose particles of ingredients along the outside of the loaf. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I will not be buying any more Sunbeam breadmakers. Big mistake. I miss my old breadmaker, and will be looking for another one. This one is going to Goodwill (so be careful what you buy there!)."
1,Model 5891 belt not available,I tried to call Sun Beam customer service for the belt. They referred me to many service centers. No one has belt available. I spends whole morning trying to locate belt for Model 5891. But I could not find one.Sun Beam customer service did not give me any help though.
1,Awful Results,"We used this bread maker 3 times and the results were awful! The first loaf was doughy in the middle and burned on the outside. Despite having fresh ingredients, we bought all new just to make sure that was the issue. Same results for loaves 2 and 3, so the machine was sent back. We have used the recipes countless times before with no issues and the ingredients were fresh, so it was clearly the fault of the machine. I would not even consider this machine unless you want the hassle of returning it."
2,nice machine,"This machine works very well and has many options for size of bread loaf, darkness of crust, and length of time until the machine starts. Depending on the type of flour, etc. it's a good idea to check the dough from time to time to see exactly when it should be baked. The option I often choose is a dough setting that kneads the bread and later after the bread is the right height the bake setting to finish the loaf. My only complaint is that the bake setting is 1 hour and cannot be extended or set for a second hour once the machine is hot. Some loaves need longer cooking."
1,Rip off,"This product doesn't work properly. And if you find one that does work, keep in mind that Palm no longer supports this model."
2,My 2 year old loves it,"My son learned to use the mouse playing this game. He loves all the games included: decorating the cake, fixing the leaks, building the bridge, etc.... He plays for an hour or so every time we put it on. Unlike Reader Rabbit, this game requires the use of the left mouse button, and that is NOT difficult for a 2 year old to learn.For a kid that likes Bob the Builder, this is a great game. I strongly recommend it."
2,Very tough cables good for making lengthy connections,"I am using 3 sets of these to connect my DVD player to 5.1 speakers. Working very well. The connectors' gold plating did come off after a few months, hence 1 star less. However, I couldn't make out any difference in the audio quality. May be the setup I have opted for making such connections will not appeal to audio purists, but this solved my purpose. Also, these cables are very very tough, really good for lengthy connections through walls and across room. I have used similar cables to make component as well as composite video connections and I am liking it very much!!"
2,"I lived it, too. Or so I thought.","What an enjoyable read! I once owned a resort in an area near to the author and I wish I would have a: read this book before I got into the business or b: had the sweet pleasure of commiseration by reading it while I was still running the place. (I think we shared some of the same guests and laughed out loud, especially during the chapter called ""Frequently Asked Questions."") It's HARD WORK! I think the author makes this clear, but at the same time, points out all of the positive things that do make a Northwoods lifestyle like a dream life. Continued success, Mrs. Cozzens."
1,Not much here,"I got this with the Complete Idiot's Guide to Running a B & B on the comments of others. I wouldn't waste your time on this book but the Idiot's guide is of value. This book has all kinds of stories that really don't help when deciding if a B & B is something I want to do. I haven't read the entire book because it just doesn't provide useful information to me, but read half with the hope of finding some gem of knowledge. There has to be a better second book out there than this."
2,Sweet Dreams!,"When asked to comment on Michelle VanOrt Cozzen's ""I'm Living Your Dream Life,"" I thought, yeah right...like I'm going to enjoy a book about creating a bed and breakfast. But I said, okay, and I haven't regretted my decision for one second.I loved ""Dream Life"" and couldn't put it down. This book is a must-read for anyone entertaining the idea of owning a bed and breakfast, and it's a book that should be in B and B gift shops throughout the nation.Bravo, Michelle! ""I'm Living Your Dream Life"" is a welcome breath of fresh air. Thanks for sharing your success. One cannot help but benefit from your experience.Laurie Birnsteel"
1,Dead Reefs,"Although it appeared to be rather frightening, it really isn't. The characters are very stilted and it's slow moving."
2,Worked to make a Mater Cake! Turns into a truck with ease!,"We used this cake pan to make a monster truck Mater ""Tormater"" cake for my son's 3rd birthday. It turned out great! The pan was really easy to work with. The cake came out perfect and we were able to cut it to look like a tow truck before decorating it without a problem. I love that we will be able to use the pan again to create a completely different cake. I was a little nervous about how hard it would be to turn this car into a truck but it was much easier than expected. Great pan!"
2,Rigorous Study,"An extraordinarily detailed survey of Spinoza's opus, the Ethics. Wolfson leaves no stone unturned in Spinoza's elaborate metaphysical-ethical system. Through an examination of the meaning of substance, attributes, and the modes of substance's expression, Wolfson unearths the principle complexities of Spinoza's system. There are extremely clear accounts of thought and extension, the three orders of knowledge, as well as the role of the will and the affections. This is the perfect companion study for any serious reader of the Ethics."
2,Very durable,"We have this bag in the x-large to line the pail, the medium for daycare and the small for quick outings. It is very durable and after over a year of washing 2-3 times a week, looks as good as it did brand new. My only complaint is that the fabric is not 100% waterproof and it does kind of ""sweat"" when ful of wet diapers."
2,good read,"This book is not an analysis of Chekov's writing or stories, so much as a leisurely travelogue through the Russian countryside where his stories unfolded. It is not a heavy work of scholarship, but provides a pleasant look at the ambiance of his stories, which should enhance one's enjoyment of them. It is worth the time.Fred"
1,Barrio Boyz... Sucks!,"Alright, give me a break. This is worth owning/watching only to laugh with your friends at how awful it is. They act like it's a documentary yet somehow there's this scene with the two gang members in the car and it cuts to a two shot of them. Just lazy stuff here. The best part about it is Spider's great young performance in this fictional movie that is definitely not a documentary and doesn't even look like one."
2,A review of The Madonna Murders,"I read the book in two sittings. It was an easy read, perfect for traveling. I was quickly engaged by the story. The book was entertaining throughout and educational at the same time. I knew little of religious iconography in general and the history of the Russian community in the San Francisco Bay area in particular. I learned a little about both.The book was particularly timely for me, as I was going out to visit the Bay area for the first time in many years. I live on the east coast. I also learned about the Crystal Skull, another icon featured in the book as well as the latest Indiana Jones movie. Again, the book was particularly timely for me, as I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull right after my reading of the book. It certainly made my viewing of the movie more enjoyable.I recommend it for someone looking for an entertaining story as well as a little education."
2,Does what it says,I've used this product twice now and gotten good results both times. It will make your teeth much more sensitive than the treatments that last a week or more if you do the whole kit in 2 hours. I prefer to use the kit once a day for a week. Less sensitivity and I was still satisfied with the level of whitening. I also found the packages of whitening gel contained way more gel than my mouth needed. I was able to use 1 package for both trays effectively doubling the number of treatments. This cut down on the gel getting on my gums and hurting them & I didn't taste it so much this way!
1,Pass on this one,"I bought the kit and had high hopes. In accordance with my nature,I did not do top and bottom teeth together, but did the top teethfirst so I could see the difference more clearly. After four sessionsthere was absolutely no discernible difference and I am unhappy."
2,Worked for me,"I used this kit last night and I found the process fairly straightforward. I hesitated on using this particular kit because of all the negative reviews but I think it depends on how much care you put into making sure the trays fit snugly so the gel doesn't burn the gums. I had to re-dip my trays in the warm water about three times to get them to fit just right. Then, I cut off the extra plastic just above where my teeth met my gums. I also only used one ampule for each application (both trays) so I have four left over that I plan on using in the future. As for the results, I do think that my teeth whitened a couple shades. I was definitely hoping for a really bright bright white, but from previous kit experiences, I know it's not that easy. Today, my teeth do feel a bit sensitive but I think that's expected. I say the Rembrandt 2-Hour Whitening Kit is worth a try if you're willing to be patient and careful with the application."
1,Not worth it,"I have to agree with all the people who said this product gives minimal results. When factoring in how umcomfortable use of the product was, I have to rate this one star and although I did not experience sores or blistering, it took several days for the pain in my gums to fade away. Don't think I've ever had a product cause so much discomfort; really should be off the market."
1,Not Impressed,I was very unhappy with the results of this product. I took pictures after every 20 minutes whitening session and I saw a very small difference. I won't ever purchase this product again.
1,I wouldnt recomend,"After using he product I did not see any great improvement. Not only that, but my teeth were in sever pain that started about an hour after I used the product and continued until the next day. If I saw significant results I wouldn't mind the pain, but as it didnt really do anything for me, it was waste of time and suffering for nothing."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"The price is good, the product works but it's not worth it to me. I used 1/2 as much gel as it said to and only used it for 20 minutes on 4 different days. My lower inner lip is blistered and hurts like hell."
1,Not for me,"I was convinced by the positive feedback that this product would indeed work for me. It's quite easy to use. Instructions are easy to follow. However, when I used it, I had to stop and take the mouthpieces out of my mouth because 3 of my teeth were in pain like being stabbed in the nerves. After the pain subsided, I continued the process. Although I had to keep stopping due to the pain, I seen a very minimal improvement. The sensitivity in my 3 teeth lasted 2 days. Not satisfied with this product at all."
1,Mouth is on fire!!!!,"You really need to check before you put this product in your mouth. The first step went good because there was no pain, and thats when everything went downhill. I tried the second gel bottles and for some weird reason my gums went crazy, they are completely swollen and its been 2 days after I did this. I will never try this again, because it is not worth that kind of pain."
1,My teeth aren't any whiter,"I bought this item because it was a gold box discounted item so it was only 8.99. It was a bit inconvienient. I assumed it would be a tray you wear for 2 hours, instead it was 4, 20 minute sessions with a ten minute break in between. The stuff kind of burned my gums and tongue and today, the day after, my gums are still a bit sensitive. After all of this, my teeth aren't any whiter. Im not a coffee drinker or a smoker so I suppose I don't have the surface stains like they might have, but still, I expected some results."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this product at a local ""Super"" store and I thought it would be like the Crest ones just faster. I was wrong on many accounts. It didn't burn so much as make my teeth very sensitive! My teeth were sensitive for months after I used the product. I did have sore gums for a while as well as having sensitivity when I brushed my teeth or drank cold drinks. I will never use this or recommend this to anyone. Horrible product, it should be taken off of the market."
2,A Still Practical Classic,"I received a copy of Wood's dictionary in the late 60s. Don't overlook the small handbook on poetry at the beginning! It will get you up and running as a poet in no time, with its fine treatment of meter, stanzas, and the ""forms."" The funny phonetic way of spelling takes time to get used to, but even if you have to ""wing it,"" you will be able to find the rhymes you need. In my withered maturity, I am fascinated by the helpfulness of the Thesaurus and a Rhyming Dictionary. I'm no slouch on vocabulary, but good reference works make it a snap to find just the right word. Take a chance on Wood's rhyming dictionary. You won't regret it!Jeremiah Cox, poet on AllPoetry and author of REDESIGNING GOD."
2,Excellent Resource!,"This is a great compliment to your thesaurus. If you write music, poetry, or any thing of the type, you will love this book. I had a copy that I had used for years, but my son ""borrowed"" mine to write his rap songs, so I had to buy another one. It has more content than you could imagine and it is easy to follow. I love this little book!"
2,Bad Boys Compilation,I thought the songs they included on the CD were a nice mix of hip hop artist and music styles. However I thought the DVD wasn't very good.
1,"Too much, to little, to late for me....","This book lacked the indepth knoledge I have grown to look for in a book by Chilton. Too many cars for one book and the info seems to be mixed up slightly. NO troubleshooting charts as is said on the back cover, so my last thought is this book is very misleading."
1,Not Worth a Penny,"I bought this book to get a better understanding of the systems on my '80 RX-7. While reading, I've spent 75% of the time trying to weed through the text trying to locate the portions that applied to my vehicle. My advice would be to buy the Haynes manual which covers the specific vehicle, as this hodge-podge is very difficult to follow.Illustrations were sparse, and the ones that are there are marginal at best. The printing company that was contracted for this job must have been the lowest bidder.I also own a Suzuki Samurai, and the Factory Service Manual for it. I reccommend the factory books where available. Unfortunately, it's not available for the RX-7s. This is NOT EVEN CLOSE to the quality of a good factory manual.One man's opinion."
1,not what I expected,there is little hard knowledge in this book to assist you with major stuff. Now what I expected at all from Chilton's.
2,Good Gift!,"I gave this to my boyfriend and he loves it! (child at heart haha)The only problem is you have to roll it back up after each use, which is not that much of a big deal when you think about it.Also, (just a heads up, in case you didn't notice) the ""bang"" flag comes out through the side of the gun, not at the top like a flag.Either way still looks great!It is not high quality so be careful with it otherwise it might break"
2,love it!,its strong and durable and fun! the only bad part is rolling up the flag but thats the way you have to do it but still a lot of fun
2,BANG! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!,"I purchased this BANG gun in 2008 to go with my Joker Halloween costume. It's pretty decent. Stuff the flag inside the folding metal barrel, pull the trigger, and BANG!!!!! (except there's no sound, of course). Every Joker should have this in his arsenal. Well, almost every Joker (Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight didn't use gadgets such as this, unfortunately).Overall, a pretty good product that will add to the fun of being The Joker."
1,Bummer Case,"I unfortunately purchased this thinking since it said this was for the Oster classic clipper it would be made just for the clipper. Actually the cardboard box works better than this case.In addition to this case I purchased the classic Oster 76 cutter and the Oster attachment combs. There isn't room for the cutter, comb attachments and cord. The case is too small and not great quality for the price although it does say Oster on the side. Not recommended. Buy another case or bag from somewhere else. A shave kit bag would be better."
1,You WONT get what you pay for !!,"The dimensions on the one they sent me are 8""x12""x3"" ..... NOT 10x9.8x19.6 as stated on this page !! Can other people that bought this PLEASE measure yours and tell me what size you received ? This is NOT what i expected !UPDATE: I complained to Amazon and was ASSURED that they would send the BIGGER case (there WAS another case offered for about $13.00 and description said 8""x12""x3"") well, once again, I was sent the SMALL Oster Clipper Case..If YOU buy this Case, you WILL get one that measures 8x12x3 ... NOT 10x9.8x 19.6 as listed on page... Amazon offered me a $6.00 credit.. exactly what the smaller case would have cost !I am NOT happy... They have removed the smaller case sold by another vendor, instead of fixing the product info on this product. BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!"
1,cheap and poorly designed,"This is supposedly a custom storage case for the relatively expensive hair clipper and attatchments that I bought at the same time. Instead, it is a cheap, crappy blow-molded plastic thing like one would expect to pay a buck for at a poorly attended flea market. The clippers kind of fit only if you don't mind tossing them in haphazardly with a wadded up cord. Forget about anything else fitting; it will only fall out when you open the case or be flipped out when you remove the clippers. You'd be better off storing everything in a worn out sock."
2,The great discovery of the 1990's,"The voice , the songs, the guest musicians-- this debut is spectacular. When you hear Toni sing you'll be a fan for life."
1,Naked Torture Double Feature,"This has to be the worst quality of any dvd i've ever seen, and I own over 2000 of them. Flesh Feast is unwatchable, you can barely tell what's going on in the movie. Three on a Meathook has some good moments and the picture is slightly better then Flesh Feast. I'd avoid this set because of the picture, it's so bad."
1,What The.......,"All I can say is the quality of the movie has to be one of the worst transfers out there. I read the other reviews and I thought people have to be warned about this dvd,it's soooo bad. It's like watching an old vhs tape on a vcr with dirty heads. The price for this cheap but it's still overpriced. Do yourself a favor stay away from this disc."
1,great tools.....BAD BATTERIES,Milwaukee 18 v NiCads suck. Buy the set as Lith Ion u will be MUCH happier
1,Verizon LG VX8300 VX5300 Travel/Home/Wall Battery AC Charger (110-240v),"The charger does not fit the phone. The insert on the charger is slightly larger than the receiver on the phone and will not plug in. The order came in a timely manner, but I cannot use it. I ordered another one from Newegg."
1,don't waste your time with this,"The seller did refund the $2.80, but you might want to know that this charger does not fit VX8300. Also, it is cheaply made, very light and does not look like it would hold up well for long. The company was late in delivery."
1,Get what you pay for,Very low price but did not fit my VX8300 phone.Item did not cost enought to send back just trashed it.
2,If you're single with a big-city perspective...,"then this is your book! A friend pressed this book on me, and I ended up laughing out loud as I read. After skimming other readers' reviews, it seems like the city dwellers (especially the NYC residents) found this particularly good, me included. It's damn funny if you're in the right frame of mind--Justine can be quite annoying at times, but you have to love her bad side! All that nastiness and she still gets the guy!"
1,A terrible book!,"I was insulted to have to pay for this awful excuse for a book. Ms. Block received an MFA from Columbia University? Clearly, she learned nothing more than how to be smug and un-funny. Revolting characters, stupid scenes, a waste of time and paper."
1,Don't bother!,"I got halfway through ""Was It Something I Said"" and realized that I didn't feel as if I ""knew"" any of the characters and what I did know of them, I did't like. The storyline was choppy (the transitions from present to past and back again were confusing) and the character development was weak. It seemed like an interesting plot but Block failed to deliver on substance."
1,""" a fanatical searcher after muck""","A lot of research but the ultimate goal seems to be character assassination, and a totally spurious association with Ian Paisley ( I suppose that helps book sales to the prurient public). Van has been exemplary in avoiding getting embroiled in the Troubles and this seems to be a belated effort to drag him into the mire.The author's judgement of Van's output seems equally flawed - Warm Love is dismissed whereas some of the more turgid later stuff is praised. There is also far too much repetition.Who is Johnny Rogan?"
1,Scrappy Printer,"Bought this printer about two years ago.Printed rather good text and pictures.Then,I did not know what happened,but the printer sucked the paper into it,causing it to jam and overheat,resulting in a blown fuse.Getting it repaired would be way too expensive,so I bought a brand new printer.This is a piece of junk.Do not ever ever buy it"
1,mac compatible???,"Amazon, when you decide to label something 'mac compatible', please check whether this is indeed the case. I spent $50 on this printer, only to find that it didn't work with my computer."
2,Great item,"Best loaf pans we've ever owned, and at a low price through Amazon. They arrived quickly and in mint condition. Yes, we'd do it again, and recommend this to anyone and everyone."
2,Lightweight and comfortable,"A nice pair of lightweight, comfortable glasses. Lightly tinted, so good for jobsite usage. However, since they are made from plain acryllic plastic, they can be easilly scratched, so you'll need a protective case for them."
2,"Great info, should be common sense!","So far, interesting information. I could do without the scenarios and questions but for $4, whats not to like. The book quality was if brand new. Im glad I didn't spend $20 for a new one."
2,Cathy,"Every American should get on the Dave Ramsey program! Thanks, looking forward to being completely debt free."
2,Very Very Stylish!,These beautiful earrings are so Stylish!I got these Earrings for my birthday and I love them!
2,We Loved It!,"This recording was a gift for my husband. It came quickly. My husband loves this cd, and plays it frequently. It inspires his poetry!"
2,Watched Nashville online,Love this show and I love the fact that I can download shows I missed onto my iPad to view at a more convenient time.
1,Would'nt recommend,I bought three Deck hand 40 anchor winches and within a three year period all have been inoperable. Also to get the part that i need i would have to buy the whole motor @ $164.00.
2,Well done!,"This is a very well done and intereting EP. The songs are catchy, unique, and surprising. Although only 4 songs, it proves that Sicboy is a band that has loads of talent. Not quite as sharp as their previous EP Tease (and that may also be related to production quality), but nevertheless its strong and worth a listen to any fan or indie rock. Stand out track: Spitting Bullets."
2,Good magnetic clip,"One of the magnets was detached from the clip - I fixed with a bit of super glue and it works fine. I use it to hold take out menu's on the fridge - each clip holds about 20 sheets of 8.5"" x 11"" printer paper without a problem."
2,This is where its at,"This book is right on. If we all were able to show Christ to the world around us the way the book encourages us to do, we would live in a different world. This is a must read for anyone wanting to make an impact on the world they live in."
1,Not the full version?,"The supplier was quick in the delivery and the merchandise arrived safely in a timely manner.I played this game on the internet, and love it, so I purchased it off of Amazon.com. I can't seem to play anything after the first level. I have re-installed it and it just keeps playing level 1 over and over again."
2,"Lukowski - that's my family name, Thank you Mr. McNally !","My borther Daniel is a masseuse in NY. One of his clients is Mr. Terrence McNally. When the book was being written, Mr. McNally did my brother and my family a great honor - the central characters' last name was to be Lukowski. What can I say but thanks !"
1,Wandering nothing.,Not any great art here. The shameless hype in the advertising notes won't make the films watchable. Like an elementary school kid's first attempt with a camera. Precious money is better spent elsewhere.
1,Boring,The pictures take too much time and they are really boring. I took them to the garbage can because they are not worth the time to resee them in the future. I feel very disappointed with Zero de Conduite because I think it does not have any argument.
2,A sheer joy to the ears,"This cd is (to my surprise) consistent all the way through. Undertow is a masterpiece, very reminiscent of Santana. The CD ""ROCKS"" love it. My kind of Salsa with English lyrics for these old non spanish speaking ears."
2,Super Salsa La differente,Whew! Just listened to this CD and it is hot. Every player is a pro and the voice of Faith has that star quality ring. Why this isn't an Amazon pick is beyond me. The whole CD is totally consistent all the way through with no junk filler like many others I have heard.
2,outstanding,"I bought this product because I am going to the beach in a few weeks. It is GREAT!!! They have the adaptor for the wall so you don't have to have a computer at hand. The remote comes with two earpiece hook-ups so that you and your significant other or friend can hear the same music without having to even open the case. This is great for the beach because it will keep all of the sand out and best of all it's small enough to carry along in your bag at the beach with room to add other things you may need to carry as well. My boyfriend liked the case so much he ordered one too. The price was perfect, It has everything you need except the car adaptor but I don't listen to it in the car so just as well. GREAT BUY!!!"
2,"Uneven, but beautiful","The more I listened to this album, the more I liked it. I say it's uneven because while some of the songs, like ""Only Talking Sense"", ""Last Day in June"", and ""Where is My Soul"" are hauntingly beautiful, others on the album are much rougher. The tone of the album changes from song to song - but that's kind of a good thing - it's good when not every song on an album sounds identical.Overall, I would say that this album was definitely worth buying, more so if you are a big Neil/Tim Finn fan, like I am."
2,Good if lightweight. Some great moments,"This is indeed no Crowded House nor even Split Enz album but it's very pleasant to listen to, and some of the songs have some great melodies. 'Only Talking Sense' is a good example: melodic, slightly off-beat, hinting at a darker side but not really exploring it. It's a bit like a good Chinese meal: much more interesting than most anything else but later on you don't feel satisfied. I wonder if the inevitable multi-tracking when two people do everything has lost some of the cohesiveness of a performance sound. Worth having and very enjoyable, but not quite great."
1,"NOT an ""authentic manga"" at all","Tokyopop has now decided to rename all of the characters' names for the second volume of this series, and will reprint the first volume with the ""new"" names. Make them get it right...don't buy the book until they fix everything."
2,Black Squareneck resonator,This is a guitar that I have been wanting for years. It has a great resonator and sounds awesome. The guitar was double packed for shipping and was delivered unharmed..
2,Side Comb,I am very pleased with this purchase and am on my way to having quite the collection of France Luxe hair pins and combs.
1,truly awful,"This movie is pure crap, it has nothing going for it, it's not even very good as a skin flick --- the dialogue is truly awful, the sex scenes are few and far between, and there is nothing good about it. Not one redeeming quality. This is the worst kind of b-movie. If I could give it a negative rating, I would."
2,Don't be a smeghead,If your are a Red Dwarf fan then I'm sure your on your way to owning every series. My younger sister and I began watching Red Dwarf when it was broadcast on PBS in America. We had to stay up until 11 pm on Saturday to see it. Way past our bed time but it was so worth being sleepy during Sunday school the next day. I wonder why smeghead never caught on.
2,Nice Acid Jazz!!,"""Unchain Your Mind"" is an interesting mix of the instrumental format that has some people shaking their heads and some people dancing their behinds off. Jazz purists will shun this music as they will say its not Jazz. People like me who love new ventures into the Jazz format will embrace it. I first heard the group in 1995 on the track ""90 Degrees in the Shade"" on an acid jazz compilation cassette. I was immediately hooked on the song and searched for the CD. With the exception of one track, a bizzare version of the ""Hawaii 5-0 theme"" that I didn't care for, this CD is great!! Recommended!!"
2,Driven to distraction a great start,This is one of the best books available on this subject and is particularly helpful for adults with the condition. The 2 follow up books are also brilliant.
1,Tearjerker,"If you are looking for an emotional catharsis about ADD/ADHD, this is the book for you. Almost 200 pages of heartbreaking case studies and personal accounts... it really follows through on the first promise of the title: RECOGNIZING ADD from childhood through adulthood.I would say that the focus of this book is more on getting that ""A-HA"" moment for adults who grew up with ADD and didn't know it. That's my opinion; I don't know whether it was the goal of the book, but that is the sense I got from reading it.The beneficial (for non-Attention-Deficit-Disordered and/or non-catharsis-needing people) bit of the book begins around Chapter 7, which discusses the steps to diagnosis (including diagnostic criteria for children and adults from the DSM-III-R, which I am pretty sure has been replaced by the DSM-IV.) The following chapter highlights practical steps that can be taken to mitigate ADD symptoms.In the end, there was not much meat in this book. Tragedy aplenty, but little else."
2,"Gregg L. Friedman MD Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","Driven to Distraction is an excellent book. It is very well organized and covers the topic of ADHD in great detail. This is an excellent book for both patients and psychiatrists to read. It is full of great information. I give Driven to Distraction 5 stars. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
2,"Sad, funny, great rock and roll","I bought this at a second-hand CD store when I sold a bunch of vinyl LPs and accumulated so much credit I didn't know how to spend it. Fortunately, I stumbled across this gem, from a hard-working Canadian band that has gone through several iterations but really got it all together on this disk. I'm So F**king Happy, I'm Not Like Madonna....it's pensive, sometimes dark, always tongue in cheek."
1,"Great Idea, poorly built","I purchased the 4.5"" silent spinner for my dwarf hamsters. I have 2 of them so I assume that the spinner gets double duty. Six days (6 Days) after purchase, the axle appears be be broken. It spins off balance and now make a clunky noise every rotation. I am really disappointed with this product. I really do think that the design is good but the construction or possibly the parts used to build it are of poor quality."
2,Good wheel,"There are not too many options for gerbil wheels, but this is the best one I've found for my gerbils. It is a good size and it spins fairly quietly. However, my gerbils like to knock it over pretty often, so the base could probably be a little heavier."
2,Quiet wheel!,This is a great wheel for both my hamsters. They love it and I love it too because it is SUPER quite! It's also very cute!
2,"Amusing, with some info on the side","This was an amusing bit of reading, with some tidbits I found useful as an Army wife and mother of a toddler, with quite a bit of time remaining for our service. However, there's a lot that was lacking for the current times. A lot has changed in the last few years regarding the family of a Military member, and perhaps a new edition should be written."
2,Solid Parker,"If you're a fan of Westlake's Parker novels you'll enjoy this one. It's the first we read of Claire, who becomes a recurring character later in the series. Parker is changing a bit, too. He begins to blur the lines between business and pleasure."
1,Waterproof good-- workouts okay,"The workouts are nothing special, but it is nice to have a book you can have at the pool. It adds variety, but did not make me a faster swimmer."
2,pattern maker for cross stitch by hobbyware,"Like it so far, really easy to import scanned items. trouble getting it to do symbol & stitch at the same time, still working on that. anxious to get started on my special project."
1,Just only for Beginner,"This book is useless for me, maybe I misunderstood the title or the introduction. I agree that the book can teach people to BEGIN bridge playing very well, but for me, an intermediate player, the contents on this book are all I had known.I had once thought this book could teach a player to play bridge with the fundamental logic, to find the key point on every hand. But after reading this book, I found this was not what I expected. All contents are BASIC. All I had read from other bridge books.Maybe someone could learn something form this book, but not me."
1,Plastic Cover Latch Breaks,"I purchased this fax because I had confidence in Panasonic products. The unit was guaranteed for 6 mos. One week after it was out of warranty, the molded plastic latch that holds the cover of the unit down broke off from the body of the unit due to continuous fibration stresses, and the machine would not work thereafter. This is a manufacturing defect in this product. Panasonic refused to replace the unit."
1,The cake didn't have the expected shape when baked,"The cake didn't have the shape of a** ball it was just an ordinary round cake, I couldn't even see the lines of the pan."
2,Georgia: Soundtrack,"I recently purchased this soundtrack because I have loved the movie, Georgia for many years and also really enjoy the singing. It is a fun to listen to CD. It has all the songs from the movie sung mostly by Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Jennifer Jason Leigh is not a very good singer (that is how her role in the movie is played), but it is fun to listen to her and be able to think about the part she played so beautifully in the film. I was very happily surprised to find out that Mare Winningham did all of her own singing and some of the songwriting and also played the guitar. This very talented actress/singer really made the movie as great as it was with her portrayal of the title role of Georgia. You probably would want to see the movie first to see how the songs were integrated into the film which then makes it more fun to listen to the CD. Anyone who is a fan of these 2 actresses will probably enjoy the music from this film. Purchase the movie too!!!"
1,Unconventional to say the least,"I liked Mr. Hadfield's straight-forward, no nonsense style, but the book seemed to jump from topic to topic seemingly without connection. It was, however, a very quick read.I finished the book several weeks ago and am still wrestling with a thumbs up or a thumbs down rating. It reminded me of an unpolished Harvey Mackay book (an author I like very much) but I am struggling to identify solid lessons learned, as I would easily be able to point out with Mackay."
1,Disgusting,This is probably the worse movie in the history of film making............. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star but it is required.
1,Turn the Volume Off or Down and Cick forward thru it,Turn down the volumne and wait for the action scenes and click to advance. Most of the movie is silly waste of time. I am sorely disappointed. I am surprized that someone bothered to make this film.
1,"don't waste your money, it's a snow job (and a sloppy one at that)","Someone somewhere decided he could disprove centuries of solid evidence of alien contact by cherry picking a few obscure, easily explainable(?) cases, and filling the rest of the hour with stuffy scientists babbling about the human need to touch the spiritual and why it's all in our heads. Never mind the Bible, Betty Hill's star map, the 50's flap over Washington, Hudson Valley, Jimmy Carter, Gordon Cooper's address to the United Nations, the Phoenix lights, Mexico City, Project SIGN, Billy Meier's unduplicatable photos and films, the innumerable trace cases, Belgian radar, Gulf Breeze, Kecksburg, Rendlesham Forest, the findings of the US Congress and the COMETA REPORT. They even call Travis Walton and his witnesses opportunistic liars. I used to have respect for PBS and Nova. Not any more."
2,1920's playful nostalgia,"Adorable send-up of British 1920s romantic comedies. Best numbers: I Want the World to Know, Spread a Little Happiness, Please Mr. Cinders, On the Amazon, and the One-Man Girl reprise. Very cute, sprightly, and yet wistful. I'm glad to have it in my collection. Trivia note: Steven Pacey of ""Blake's 7"" is one of the 3 male leads, and sings ""I Want the World to Know."""
2,Excellent Product,"This ceramic dish is well-made and quite durable. It browns casseroles very well and puts a nice crust on them. Clean-up is easy (I always spray it with non-stick spray before using) and even after baking the dish in the over for a few hours, it cleans up easily with hot water and a scrubby sponge. The nice thing with this dish (as opposed to clear glass baking dishes) is this one goes from oven to table and looks nice on the table when you have guests for dinner. (Also, I have some of the glass baking dishes and they don't clean up so easily). I have both the 14 inch dish and the 9 inch dish for smaller casseroles. Both are excellent. I am a serious home cook and recommend them highly."
2,I'm impressed...,"Shoottokill, written and produced by Ak1200 is definitely a nice addition to my Dance & DJ collection. This CD is full of great beats, high energy and wonderful vocals. Ak1200 offers a nice blend of D&B and Hip/Hop that will be sure to energize just about anyone. Ak1200 has proven himself to be a great artist as well as a great producer.This is definitely worth a listen."
2,Enough Said,A full album of tracks both written and produced by AK1200 himself... is there even the possibility of it getting less than a 5?
1,Boring,"I found this dvd about cycling to be boring. Watch ""Hell on Wheels"", with Erik Zabel. Much more interesting story about what it takes to get through the Tour de France."
2,Awesome Endurance Sports Story,Recommended to anyone into endurance sports. And even some who are not. Great story about pushing the limits. Incredible what these people put themselves through.
1,Yo Einstein!,"If you click the bold and quite obvious ""READ TERMS AND CONDITIONS LINK"" you can see exactly what is covered and don't have to wait until after you bought it to see what is/is not covered. That being said, this is just an extension of service for the regular warranty and does not cover accidents or things like that. Usually at other retailers, a plan at this price covers even customer accidents like dropping it, etc."
1,Most Service Contracts Are A Waste Of $$$$$,I rarely if ever buy a service contract for anything. Most service contracts are a waste of money!!! Technology is changing so fast... will you even want to bother trying to fix the item?? Will it be worth it??? Save your money for another product and you'll have another warranty with it.
2,Very good,"By reading this book you can really understand exactly what the examinators (including computer examinator) are expecting and looking for in a GMAT essay.You must have your own writing skills, but this book can definitely help with the format and key-phrases."
2,works,"The denta clean mouth wash is very easy to use, and it works wonderfully - completely eliminates any odor. This becomes painfully obvious when we run out... as I cant always find it locally. My dog did not want to drink his water at first, but it did not last long (ie one time), and now he is hesitant to drink water without the mouth wash in it."
1,WAY too expensive!!!,"These dolls are great overall...I bought them for the Loving Family Townhouse that I bought used for my daughter, and they go very nicely with it. However, they are extremely over-priced! You can buy them for $5-$6 per 2-pack of the figures (mom and toddler; grandma and brother; dad and sister) at any national toy retailer/discount store. At most, they should cost $20, not $50, especially since they're still widely available (the shelves were full when I bought all three 2-packs this week!)."
1,Marketeers Cheapen Product,"Dundee WAS an excellent Orange Marmalade, but has been adulterated with almost NO PEEL and LOTS of PECTIN. Furthermore, it has been sufficiently sweetened to mask any remaining orange flavor. DO NOT BUY !"
2,any man.s death,"the action starts fast and never lets up. The setting is Detroit Michigan during the 1980's Reverend Thomas Aqinas Sunsmith is preaching in his house of worship on a sunday morning,one of his choir members attempts to shoot him when his personal bodyguards {4}shoot her down. Inspector Pontier i nvestigates the situation and assigns Police protection for him. A war among two Detroit Mafia factions is brewing.Mike Boniface former head. Charles Maggiore who assumed power while Boniface was in prison. Boniface is back and wants his power back. Reverend Sunsmith is collecting money from his congregation, a rich woman named Carmen Thralberg,Charles Maggiore and working a Pyramid scheme. Reverend Sunsmith opposes Casino Gambling in Detroit which is Charles Maggiore's pet project. Hitman Pete Macklin,Charles Maggiore,Inspector Pontier, Carmen Thralberg, Mike Boniface all want to keep the Black preacher alive but someone wants him dead."
1,A waste of my $14,I can't believe i paid for this crap but i wont be writing anything that hasn't already said about why not to buy this dvd. The background music was totally f***ed up and only pictures of the band were shown i was expecting something like on the extra stuff from their self-titled cd. Even the 'Music In High Places' dvd was better. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this dvd.
1,Never received contract,"We purchased an extended 3 year service contract from Amazon on 1/20/06, and after three phone calls in which we were told we would get the confirming contract, as of 3/13/06 we still never received it."
1,don't buy it in paperback!!!,"This is a wonderful book to study the Bible with, but in paperback it is just about impossible to read, because it'a thick book that is not well made. The pages are very thin and the cover is flimsy so it's hard to find a particular section and once you find it, if you bend the cover to keep it open so you can read it, it creases the cover. I had this in hardcover and it was wonderful. I lent that copy to a friend. Big mistake."
2,"Variety for your kids, fun recipes for you","What I love about this book is the array of foods the author uses. I love Anabel Karmel's cookbooks, but she suggests making the same boring foods for our kids. Baby Bistro is fun, flavorful, and the recipes are so easy! I wasn't having much luck getting my son to eat different flavors and textures after eating baby food and pureed foods. Now I make a fun recipe from this cookbook each day and he eats it. Not only does he eat the recipes, he hums while eating them. That's a good thing!Enjoy!"
1,Viewsonic VSATV26324-1W $600+ dollars,"This TV/flat panel monitor died right after the warranty ended. The only thing worse was calling the Viewsonic tech support. They were totally useless. Didn't even try to help with any trouble shooting. Would not point me to a schematic, or suggest known parts that fail all the time. They just kept saying look for a repairman in the yellow pages. You might want to consider a company with a good track record for tech support before purchasing your next flat panel."
2,Signature has made its mark!,"This CD exemplifies the meaning of the words, classic, mellow, smooth and romantic. All I can say is PLEASE BUY IT! My favorites are ""Days Gone By"", ""Hurry Up This Way Again"" and ""Wise Ole Souls"". Anyone buying this CD will not be disappointed. ""Signature"" is a must have for your music collection."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"These pillows are lumpy. The layers of memory foam are not very thick, and the material stuffed in between them is hard and uncomfortable. I bought these to replace the pillows I had bought from Walgreen's a couple years ago, but the pillows from Walgreen's were far superior. I don't even use these pillows, they were a complete waste of my money! If I could give a negative star rating I would..."
2,Great classroom/small room system,"You couldn't want more!! It plays DVD's , CD's allows you to plug in all of your components (projector, laptop, vcr, computer) and everything works and is happy. The volume is JUST loud eneoug for a small (28X25) classroom and the system is small enough not to take up space. I wish I had bought one for myself. I look longingly at it in my classroom and want to do the ""dummy dance"" for passing up the chance to purchase!"
2,Very nice.,"This is nice and sturdy. I have had a ton of muffin pans and none have been this nice. I've only had it for a short while, but it appears to be very durable. I really like this and would recommend it. I'm not really a baker, but this is sturdy, cooks evenly and is easy to clean."
2,Great,"My husband and I watched it a few episodes every night and enjoyed watching Don grow and learning his story. Endeared to many characters, Peggy, Joan and Roger"
1,artificial conan story?,"i think this is actually the worst conan-story i have read. the plot didn't grab me, seemed to artificial to me. melodramatic. so the rest seemed pretty dull to me too. i never really believed in this story, which was carried out in a dull way too. not much suspence"
2,I needed these for my smoker,"Now I can smoke meat in my smoker, and annoy my neighbors with all those tasty meat smells for hours at a time."
1,"Fun stories, but poorly bound","We purchased these books for our Star-Wars obsessed 4 year old boy. My wife and I enjoy reading the stories to him because they hold his interest, which allows us to keep the t.v. turned off. After a week of moderate use, the pages started falling out. We returned the first book we purchased and ordered a few more volumes in this series. Both the replacement book and the new volumes have the same problem with the pages falling out. If you intend on reading these books more than once, do not purchase them."
1,Not a Traditional History,"This book has some interesting sections, but those looking for a more traditional history, either chronological or thematic, will be disappointed. I read the entire book and it is consistent throughout in reading more like a casual essay or a collection of thoughts, loosely structured around the chronology of the Ottoman Empire (the subtitle ""A History of the Ottoman Empire"" would better have been dropped). The specifics of historical events are often left out, making it difficult to investigate things further if one wished. Additionally, and a big sin in history works in my opinion, there were constant references to various regions and cities with extremely little in the way of historical maps to help the reader."
1,Mostly unintelligble.,"Long and badly structured sentences, unknown English and foreign words sprinkled about like acid rain, different eras mixed up and combined in unintelligable sequence, hasty and brief comments about the most important events in the Ottoman empire's history make this book a total waste of time. I, too, bought it after reading the Times review. I have found that the reviews of the NY Times are not as dependable as they used to be. If you want to learn about the Empire, buy another book."
1,More like a collection of opinions about the Ottoman Empire,"I have to agree with previous reviewers that this book was more like a collection of anecdotes than a thorough history. I was glad when I was finished with this one, and feel like I don't know a whole lot more about the Ottoman Empire than before I read it. The author fixates on elements of culture such as dress, and tries to draw grand conclusions from them, and writes with such sweeping generalization and a lack of economy of language that lots of important questions remain unanswered. For instance, it is not clear explained why the Ottomans forced conversions in some cases, but not in others. I have to buy another book if I want to know."
1,Impressionist history of the Ottoman Empire,"As with many modern English books of history, this one is nicely written but fails in what I assume to be the key purpose of a survey history: to tell us what happened and the context for it. We get a lot of both in this book but they are combined in an impresionistic flow. Events in three different centuries are addressed in the same paragraph which gives context but forecloses any chronological progression. In other sections, events are described in detail but with little context. Mr. Goodwin also assumes a great deal of knowledge on the part of the reader. As one of the very many who know little of the Empire, I felt constantly behind the curve, much like I would attending a graduate lecture on the topic. I would take something away, and might enjoy the presentation, but much of what I heard would be lost.And it has no good maps."
1,"Good anecdotal, but needs editing","I agree with the other negative reviews. I also wish to add that the glossary was very weak, and the one map in the book was not sufficient. He mentions many cities and a maps would help. A minimum about slavery and other negatives. Did evoke many pictures and moods of the empire. Much too sketchy and poorly organzied. Needs an editor or a rewrite."
1,A Great Disappointment,"Much of the criticism of this book in the Amazon.Com reviews appears to be from people who are hostile to Turkey. I am not. Turkey was a haven for my family for over 400 years (Jewish refugees from Spain) and is a country for which I have great respect and affection. What I didn't like was the book. I rushed to buy it after reading a gushing review in The New York Times Sunday book review section. Were we reading different books? I found the book to be glib, superficial, slick and uninformative. A fascinating subject deserved better."
1,Does not work with newer netgear FVS318 VPN router,"Purchased this because it was supposed to work with the Netgear FVS318 VPN router. Got it, it didn't work, found out that this software is version 8, and that it will only work with the older router firmware 1.4. Firmware 1.4 will only load on the older FVS318 routers (serial numbers starting with FVS8). Had to return it and get the Netgear VPN software which is version 10. If you have the older router and downgrade the firmware, this may work for you."
2,fantastic,really great book! So full of interesting and very helpful information! Takes thing from the airy-fairy thinking of be positive and we really can help ourselves self help mumbo to the explaining from a scientific point of view just exactly how and why with things. He does it for laymen to understand as well. I love his writings - this is a great one!
2,Not the Usual Home Remodel,The foreign home restoration genre takes a real turn with Tahir Shah's experiences in Casablanca. His patience was amazing. I would have gone stark raving mad. I enjoyed his writing and have gone on to other books written by him. His wife must be a saint to have put up with all of the Caliph's House problems.
2,"great, imaginative, thought provoking, really enjoyed it.",This movie was very entertaining. I intend to pursue others by the same producer/director. Very imaginative and thought provoking. Plan to watch it again.
1,Haier Portable DVD is a waste of $$$,"I own this piece of...equipment. It was given to me for Christmas from my Daughter and I Loved it! UNTIL...it quit, just quit. It was manufactured in October 2006, I received it Christmas 2006, it's warrnty was good until March 2007 and it quit April 2007. When I got in touch with the Company they said, ""Sorry!!!""...and when I quizzed a friend of mine who owns a T.V. Store and Electronics Repair Shop he said most shops don't repair them because the parts cost more than the Unit and even if they did repair them the labor would be equal to the cost of a new Unit. His recommendation, either buy American or buy an extended warranty if one is available and if you buy one as a Gift, purchase the warranty as part of the gift as well. As for my ""Haier"" Portable DVD, it's somewhere between the Potato peelings and the Carrot shavings."
1,The Day John Died by Christopher Anderson,"I was extremely disappointed with this most current book about the lives and tradgedies of the Kennedy family. I am a Kennedy ""buff"" and have bought many books about the Kennedy family. This book was not a book about John and the day he died, but a rehash of many books written about Jack, Jackie and their children. The first and last chapters were about the day John died. I was sorry I spent money on it because I thought it would be a valuable addition to my Kennedy library. The newspapers and magazines I bought when John died do a better job of reporting what happened that day then this book did. I am eagerly awaiting the book that someone else will write and will focus on what happened The Day John Died and how we, as a nation were in shock again just like on November 22, 1963."
2,Why so nasty?,"I am surprised at the nasty tone of some of our fellow reviewers! Why excoriate others who freely choose to read a specific book about someone they are interestered in? Some like the book, others don't. Express your opinion about the book, but don't insult others doing it, ok? Life is too short. Be Kind."
1,Not worth the time or effort,"The book, to me, was just a shabby biography with two small sections at the beginning of the book and another at the end that gave a slight overview of the plane trip and subsequent crash.Save yourself time and find a book by a more reputable source."
1,a rehash of old people and newsweek articles,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. If you have read any old articles on JFK Jr. in People magazine or Newsweek, you have read this book. Plus, the author lifted most of information from earlier written books on Jackie. The first and last chapter were the only chapters spent on the day John died. The rest of the chapters are on how Jackie raised John. I could have clipped out articles from People, Newsweek and the Enquirer, thrown in old photos and written this book."
2,Great Book,"This is a wonderful tribute to JFK jr. Lots of information about John, his life growing up and untill the end. Yes there is only one chapter dedicated to the days leading up to his death, and also the plane ride itself and what happened, why he crashed. How much do people want?? A whole book about the day he died would be stupid not to mention morbid. I would rather read about his life. Also, the author has a style of writing that is easy to understand, making the book interesting. I am so glad I got this book, and I will keep it on my shelf forever as a tribute to Americas son."
1,Not what I expected at all!!!,"I thought the Ezonics EZDual Cam was going to be a great product, but it was not what I expected. The installing of the drivers and software was pretty easy. The software it brought for editing pictures is not very user-friendly and doesn't run very smoothly. I was not happy with the quality of the photos it took nor the quality of the video. The video had a huge delay, you could look at the camera and back at your monitor and you would still be looking at yourself. Plus, every movement is blurred. Forget about moving around!!! As for using it as a camera, not good at all. Again,, blurred!! Whatever you are taking a picture of better be super still and you better put the camera on a tripod because any little movement and the picture comes out blurred. I mainly wanted the camera to take pictures to email to my family, but as bad as the pictures come out, its best to use a regular camera and just scan them.. Very cheap quality!!"
1,"Maybe it's just me but, the product seems ...","Maybe it's just me but, the product seems to have a backwards affect on me. It kept me awake more than it helped me to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this product for someone trying to get some sleep."
2,Smartypants,"There is enough funny stuff in this small book for either male or female to score, let alone get to second base!"
1,The Britney Spears of Anime,"Over the time that I've wasted viewing this garbage, it's perfectly suitable to call Sailor Moon the Britney Spears of anime--both are overhyped pieces of crap with no depth and meaningless dialogue. But at least Britney Spears is pretty, whereas Usagi has gigantic eyes that bulge out of her brainless head. If you want to buy something that's actually decent, buy Cardcaptor Sakura or Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, because they are the TRUE Queens of the Mahou Shoujo genre."
1,Buyer Beware,"I recently purchased this set and to my surprise have come to find this set to be a bootleg copy. From all accounts the DVDs play fine in English but don't work in Japanese. Oddly enough the option is available though it doesn't work. For anyone wanting the real deal, make sure you buy only Region 1 DVDs and be very skeptical of anything claiming to be ""all regions"" or ""region 0"" as these are almost always bootleg copies."
2,I love This soo MuCh,This is one awesome anime and the dvd box set rules so hard!! This is the season where pluto and neptune come out. I love those 2!!! if you are a sm fan u will buy this!
2,Marmalade mistery tour,"This is a masterpiece, that transmits sincerity and talent.Very beautiful voices (Dean Ford sings after in some song of ""Alan Parsons Project"") and many acoustic and pastoral songs.The first CD is a very good one, but contains 2 or 3 weaker songs, with some orchestral influence. The second CD is the more stylish (The only CD that includes Hugh Nicholson talent).Power Pop's fans don't knows that is one of the first Power Pop CD. Maybe because the posterior career, with some other members, was a melancholic one. It's a different story than Badfinger or Big Star.Nowadays the world only knows the hit ""Reflections of my Life"".It's a mystery that nobody talks about Marmalade. It's unfair.I don't recommend the previous release ""I see the Rain (The CBS Years)"", though contains 2 or 3 excellent songs, like the gorgeous Beatlesque ""I see the rain""."
1,Nothing exceptional about this mouse,"I bought this mouse for the advertised features and used it for a full day at work. It's just an ordinary piece of equipment and there is nothing exceptional about it. I am not sure what they mean by 20X more tracking power, there is really no difference between this and an ordinary optical mouse. The scroll wheel sticks on the one I bought making it annoying and the scroll up and down buttons are really in an awkward place. There is no right/left scroll capability that you see even in a cheap $10 Microsoft mouse.The fact that it is RF and no line-of-sight is required, is probably the one and only feature I liked about this mouse."
1,"5 stars, if ur a girl",I played for 20 min and i gave the game to my sis. Looked to me like a solid rpg but the music and the storyline is just for girls. Try ff7 or chrono cross instead.
1,"Tiny Steps, Unhappy Comany","Steps were too small for my 6 pound dog. That's too darn small!The company was smart alec about my wanting to return the steps.Also, I returned them quickly and am still waiting for a credit, beginning to wonder if I will ever get my money back."
2,This CD utterly ROCKS!,"I got this CD a month or two ago after seeing ""Above"" on MTV's return of the rock, and each song just got better and better! They're gonna be a hit here in the states, I'm sure of it!"
2,Best Finger 11 CD EVER!!!,"I got this CD of a friend a few years ago, and it sucked my right in...I Bought It and the Greyest of Blue Skies as well. If your into getting Finger 11 get this CD first, then greyest of blue skies.. and The self titled new one has 2 not so good singles I didn't even bother listening to it yet, why would I if I have tip ?"
2,One of the best albums out there to pick up,"This is one of those albums that you can put in your player and listen to the whole way through over and over again and not get sick of it. The lead singer's voice is similar to that of Raine Maida's voice from Our Lady Peace as they both have a tremendous range. Seeing as how both bands are Canadian, they are very similar, but Finger 11 is a little more mainstream alternative with more electric guitar in their sound. Popular radio hits such as ""Quicksand"" and ""Above"" gave this band a name and some recognition. The rest of the CD contains songs just as good as these. ""Awake and dreaming"" is an excellent tune as it has its sentimental side yet completely rocks at the right times. ""Tip"", ""Shudder"", ""Condenser"", and ""Thin Spirits"" are also great tracks. Buy this album...If you like alternative, rock, etc... you won't be disappointed with this album."
1,a waste of money....,"A better title for this book might have been ""The Small Parrot Handbook"". I thought I was getting an in depth handbook on parrotlet care and breeding, but what I got was a book that deals in generalities of many different birds. Forget buying this book. You will learn much more from surfing the web. A total waste of money. Wait! I have just discovered that if you carefully remove the pages, they will fit perfectly 3 wide by 3 deep in the bottom of my bird cage. Maybe I should give another star..."
2,"Superbly researched, richly woven","A fine historical novel, the characters are well-defined, they become real flesh and blood and bones and hearts and souls. I especially enjoy Parteger's talent for creating period dialogue, something she has done so well in the Cadfael series and she doesn't fail us here either. Would that our language today was so beautifully expressive! An immensely satisfying book, very human and very timeless in its triumphs and tragedies. I highly recommend it."
1,set this house on fire,I am still waiting to receive the book. The seller insists that I received it but has not re-sent it or refunded my money.
1,keep looking,"I have read many books about the old west, and this one is not that informative. The story is hard to follow, it does not read like an actual first person narrative. It was common to fictionalize current events at the time to sell books(Dime novels for example) and newspapers, and Native Americans almost always got the short end. Yes, horrible things happened, but this book seems to go out of its way to demonize all Native Americans. Several events pop up here that are recorded nowhere else. This book just feels like poorly written fiction. The flow of the narrative is off, it just does not track with history. Definatley written by a third party."
2,World class jazz album.,"This album is cutting edge New York jazz. Dave Scott is a seasoned professional,having played on both coasts for over 20 years. His sidemen are also world class players. The songs are all originals by Scott and he gives his sidemen all the room they need to improvise. The improv is all fresh but somehow comforting, you never know where these cats are going but you are sure it's going to be fun. This group has rock solid time and all the players have the chops and the confidence to play with it any way they want. Try to catch Scott's group live in New York if you have the chance."
2,I Smell Christmas: Scratch - And- Sniff Book (Little Critter),"I am a kindergarten teacher and my students love this book. Over the years some of the stickers have lost their ""smells"". I am looking to buy replacement stickers for this story. My students would be so happy. Pkease let me know how to buy more stickers."
1,Boring,"My five year old loves Ben 10, but found this game boring. There is no real mental challege. The games rolls the dice for the player, you move a certain number of spaces, then perform a task. The task is unchallenging. The game is also long and difficult to win."
2,Great Book,"I had to purchase the Idiot's Guide to Jesus for my religion class, it is a great book and breaks everything down an informative way. I would recommend this book to any one."
1,OCR difficult to read,"This is book was made by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 1. There are many typos. 2. The original footnotes are in a double columns, so the OCR process mixes the footnotes up. 3. The lovely pictures are not included. 4. The chapter Titles look no different than the body of the text. 5 There is no spacing between paragraphs. It is not much fun using a book produced this way. Buy a copy that is not produced by OCR!This review only applies to copies produced by OCR."
2,My son clapped for the songs even while running a fever,"My 23 month old son loves this CD. He cannot listen to it enough. Recently, while he was running a fever, he was not eating or drinking much; he only seemed comforted by lying on my chest and listening to this CD; he kept his head down throughout each song, but would raise himself up to clap and say yea at the end of each song to show his appreciation. I don't think that he could give it any higher praise than that. My wife and I thoroughly enjoy the songs too."
1,I Can't Stomach It,"ANY movie that has a scene with a guy making out with a grandma should be banned. Gross.The whole movie is disgusting in general. It's about a woman who discovers a cure for old age in Africa. But the cure only lasts for a day, and it must be mixed with the juice of a freshly killed person for it to work at all. So for the woman to stay alive and young, she must continually kill, and THAT'S why she's called the leech woman. She leeches off of others to retain her youth. It's actually a good plot, but the movie is so disgusting I have a hard time watching it.I've seen plenty of movies worse than this one, but I haven't seen many grosser than this."
2,It is great,i love the song and Mariah--I just wish that she would get over that ego thing she's got going on
2,THE NEW BREED OF ROCK!,"The sound of Rage against the machine and Soundgarden is just ground breaking. Chris Cornell's vocals are amazing and the members of rage are just outstanding in this cd.The the sound is totally different compared to the music thats out there now. Its definetly a song-orientated, hard rock album - something that seems rare these days.Im telling you this album kicks (...) and you will not be dissapointed."
2,good,this movie came on time..i dont understand what is being said or sung but my autistic son loves watching it
2,"Best for the money, but.....","I think this is the best VCR for the buck. I have owned several VCR's since their inception, and RCA is my favorite. HOWEVER, although this one has many attractive features for the price, it does have some shortcomings. Can you believe the channel number is NOT displayed on the front panel? This is a major shortcoming. Add to this that we cannot get the remote control to communicate with our Sony TV and there you have it. Nevertheless, I am keeping the unit as a 2nd VCR because it has enough good features for the money to be worth it. One feature making the RCA standout is the ""ShowSaver"" which keeps my hard-earned programming intact during power outages. I wish all my electronic gizmos, clocks, answering machines, etc. had this feature."
1,Frustrating and inaccurate,"Haynes manuals used to be fantastic; sadly, that is not the case with this one. Some key information is just plain wrong! For example, the description of how to replace the rear suspension arms contains some serious omissions. Even a simple operation like removing a front seat is explained in an inadequate and slipshod manner (yes, I am still trying to figure out how to do it).Maybe detailed diagrams like those found in competing manuals (e.g., Chilton) would be more useful than the photographs in this manual.Haynes claims that the manual is based on a complete tear-down and rebuild; was it a Camry they were working on?"
2,Excellent resource for those doing historical criminology research.,"This book is a collection of period documents relating to piracy and its effects. Would not suggest as a primary resource for knowledge of the period, but is an excellent secondary source for details that aren't available in more narrative based historical books."
1,Huh?????,"I don't get it. This book got stellar reviews, was written by the incomparable Anne Stuart, and features a unique hero....Why did I dislike it so?Here are some of my reasons:1. I felt like the story was boring. A boring Chalice was the ""centerpiece"" of the plot and the story contained a host of characters that I didn't care for.2. A strange romance between a court jester and a lady...one that I struggled to understand and accept.3. A different kind of secondary romance between the heroine's mother and her husband.4. This was just a very difficult book to get through. I didn't like the plot, the characters, or the romance.... which should've earned it a dismal 1 star, but Anne Stuart's superb writing earn it the extra star,I recommend Lord of Danger, Ritual Sins, Nightfall, A Rose After Midnight, and To Love a Dark Lord."
1,A Musical Feast for the Ears,Kottke is always an amazing guitarist to listen to. This video is laid back and comfortable to watch and is a guitar lovers musical feast. Enjoy it!
2,Coevettte Encyclopedia,I bought this for a Christmas gift.It was a great hit. My son and his fiance really like using it.
2,Good product,"I bought 3 of these to hang 2 electric guitars and 1 electric bass. This product works really well. The hangers look pretty good - they have a low profile so they don't stick out too far from the wall. The installation was pretty easy. I drilled the screws through the drywall into studs. They are very sturdy. I'm not not sure I would trust the drywall screws alone to hang something as heavy as my electric bass, but with the screws in a stud it works very well."
2,Great Product,I bought two of these for my husband. He has several guitars all lined up on the floor in stands. They are a bit jammed so I thought it would be nice to get a couple off the floor and on to the wall. They will then look like art! They come with some gigantic wall anchors so I hope he finds a stud to screw them into instead. I don't want a huge hole in the wall if they need to be moved someday. They are nicely made and sturdy.
2,String Swing Metal,"I have about 10 of these in my guitar room now, and I love em! I used to use floor stands, but these are so much more sensible and convenient. By getting your guitars off the floor, they don't get bumped into/knocked over, and they really free up space.The installation is cake, and you won't be disappointed in the String Swing's stability. Your guitars will look as if they are on display, and I have discovered that your ""musically curious"" buddies won't mess with the instruments that are hanging on the wall.This is just my personal opinion, but I prefer the lower-profile of the metal plate design over the wood block version of this item.If you're considering these, get 'em!"
2,Fully Explains Fundamental Relationships,"Once you learn how to read deeply (and maybe a few years after freshman physics), this is THE book to read. Asimov has a science-type Ph.D. from Columbia (the Ivy league one) and he is a wonderful story teller. Still, I tried to read this book in high school and it meant nearly nothing to me then. But I tried again in graduate school (after completing ABET ECE degree) and was rewarded. Each and every page gave me just what my mind and heart desired. It was a heavenly experience to have even a synthetic relationship/conversation with Asimov and his mid-20th century Columbia Univeristy physics department. By the way, I'm pretty sure L. Ron Hubard's cult and its followers ripped off MEST (Mass, Energy, Time, and Space) from this book."
2,just as advertised,I ordered this bluetooth and got exactly what I ordered. Came on time and works perfectly fine. Good price compared to retail.
1,blah,"the deliver of the book was excellent got it on time to do my homework, wasnt quite a fan of the book."
1,Good product-bad book,"The first time I read this book I had already sworn not to spend one more dime on any weight-loss product ever again, including books, so I took it out of the library. Like most, I read the book and thought OK, so where do you get hcg injections if they're not legal in the USA. Of course if you subscribe to his website (an additional $10 a month) he will tell you. No Thanks!I recently saw a naturopathic physician who recommended hcg therapy for weight loss. She told me she had several patients who used it and she used it herself with fantastic results. She said the product is exactly what he wrote about in his book. She told me she would support me and told me how to go about getting it. The thing is, he sounds so crazy it's hard to believe anything he writes. He sounds like he needs to be locked up in a mental institution!"
1,What the crap?,"This book is garbage!! The ""secret"" to losing all the weight in this book is through a series of injections of Hcg(a hormone that is produced by pregnant women) There are few if any doctors who are willing to give you a presription to do this, and not only that but the injections are ILLEGAL in the United States, so the author suggests that you should seek help with this with doctors overseas! I can't believe that I actually bought this piece of garbage, and I am hoping that this review will turn more buyers off of this book! Why would you tell people about this information if they can't even do it legally? And I am sorry, but I don't think this information is worth the amount I paid for it!"
1,Too bad I can't give it ZERO stars!,"A hoax and a ripoff. If you are really interested, get it from the library. DO NOT put money into this charlatan's pockets!"
1,trash material,Total waste of time and money and conveniently leaves out the fact that this weight loss requires daily injections. Shouldn't be allowed to be advertised or sold because it is so misleading. How it got any stars is a miracle. There should be a choice for NO STARS
1,steer clear,Trudeau is a con artist growing rich from the money flowing from the desperate and the ignorant. Do a little actual research on him.
1,Don't waste your money......,"This book was a total waste of money. He claims on his ""infomercial"" that you just take this ""easy"" product once a day but what he doesn't tell you is that it is an INJECTION that you must get from a doctor. Some of what he said was valid but most of it was a load of crap. When he said you just take this product once a day I thought he was talking about a pill or something. Not something I would have to inject! Do not buy this book."
1,ashamed to sell this book,"I own this book and planned to try to sell it on amazon, but I, like many of the customers, was terribly disappointed by the impractical suggestions in the book. I wish I could have glanced through it before buying it online. It is a waste of money and I would rather than donate it to a library or throw it in the garbage or recycle bin than sell it to some unsuspecting person. I cannot with good conscience sell it."
1,Don't buy - he just wants to sell you some crap.,I got suckered into buying this book and half way through he says the diet will only work if you buy some crap from him that you can't get anywhere else. A complete waste of money and time. Probably unsafe.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I was extremely disappointed with this book that offers advice that only the wealthy could afford to follow. Also, his plan is anything but easy!! I would have to spend the majority of my day popping all the supplements he recommends, doing the various exercises, colon cleansing, sauna treatments etc. Only people without a life could follow this diet. I wish I had purchased the book through his website so I could get my money back with his ""money back guarantee"". Next time I see Kevin Trudeau's face on t.v., I'll be racing to switch the channel!!"
1,Don't Buy It!,"Want to know the ""secret"" that this author tantalizes you with? It's daily injections of URINE from a pregnant woman and to avoid all dairy products and foods that have preservatives in them. This book is total garbage! Don't buy it unless you just want to throw away your money and use the book for a fire starter!"
1,A Disappointment,"This book is a disappointment. All the hype lead me to believe that there might be some valuable information here, which was not the case. Nothing much that was new, and a lot of these suggestions offered in this book, are just simply impractical, unless you have unlimited funds and unlimited time.Consider waiting until this book hits your public library and then checking it out. You might find some nuggets that will be helpful for you, but most people who are really interested in weightloss already know most of this stuff.I think that unless you are one of the idle rich who's a diet plan freak, you will find this book a real disappointment."
1,this guy is a danger to society,"I'll start by saying A) I don't work for the diet industry, medical industry, or ""Big Pharma,"" and I think it's pretty sad that those of you who have bought into Trudeau's propaganda are convinced that anyone who doesn't agree with this garbage is part of a mass conspiracy.Kevin Trudeau is a convicted con artist. His conviction came as a result of propaganda campaigns saying things very similar to what he says in this book. He is no longer allowed to do his infomercials because he repeartedly got caught making false claims. That's why he's been relegated to writing books now... because he can't sell any particular product.So, I ask all you who believe a work this croc writes if you're actually willing to take advice about something as important as your health from a man with this kind of background. If so, it's a great example of Darwinism."
1,better have some bucks,"while following the so called protacol might indeed result in weight loss, not many can afford it. to do this while working a forty hour week or more is next to impossible if you are to follow it exactly which it states many times is critical. this program will run easily into the thousands of dollars if done properly, basically a weight loss plan for the non working rich. to bad he doesnt mention any of this in his tv ads."
2,This Is The Cure!,I've been doing the protocols and everything I possibly could on this diet. and the results have been nothing short of amazing. If money is a problem then I geuss really have to ask yourself if you really want to lose the weight? I lost 70 pounds in nine months. This is the first diet that made sense and felt good while doing it. The closer you can follow his directions the faster the results will be. As for Kevin Trudeau's reputation I think you again have to ask yourself how much do you want what he offers? He offers more than Dr Simeons protocol he fully understands and has dealt with these situations in his life and has used these techniques and continues to use these techniques and it works great for him. But the fact remains if you have a negative view of losing weight you will never lose weight no matter what you try. Until you believe you'll lose weight you will fail.
1,Not so great,"This book doesn't really tell you anything practical you can use. I agree that we should eat as much organic as possible, but you don't need to read a book to tell you that. The shots described....who know where you can even get them. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,what a rip off,"Short and sweet, you need to be under a doctor's care for this miracle to work. Guess telling you that before you buy the stupid book would hurt sales."
1,Don't waste your money,"It is a complete waste of your money. There are so many inconsistencies in the material. Trudeau gives great interviews, but his book is very impractical if you want to lose weight."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This book is complete rubbish. If it is indicative of the author's other efforts, I would suggest you avoid them all."
1,The Cure you don't want to touch with a bargepole,"Take the longest one you can find and use it to move this book as far away from you as you can.Injecting human gonadotropin makes your body think it's pregnant, in other words plays havoc with your hormone system. This book recommends such injections to all and sundry irrespective of their physical condition or past history (what about all those cancer patients out there?)At a later point Mr. T. once again recommends to stay away from drugs of all kinds - well, let me be as repetitive as aforementioned Mr. T. and say again: Stay away from him."
1,this book was not helpful at all!,not helpful when they tell you to take injections!! I thought it was a waste of paper and threw it away promptly after reading it.
1,If it sounds good to be true........ it usually is,"I saw this guy on tv today and decided to check out his books on Amazon. Just what I thought. Total and complete scam. Those of us who need to lose weight know what we have to do. Be careful what you eat and exercise. Too bad thats easier said than done. There's no magic pill or cure for weight loss,just hard work. Just ""google"" this guy and see what I mean. He has a long criminal history, and tons of continuing legal problems that he blames on everyone else. Remember, ""If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is"" 0 stars for being a scam artist!!"
1,Kevin Trudeau sucks,"What a boring book. He says the same things OVER and OVER again, chapter to chapter. Very badly written. Actually, it reads as though it were transcribed from several of his lectures and infomercials. The secret he reveals to the world includes the facts that you have to refrain from all prescription meds while on the ""protocol"" (he maintains it's NOT a diet ... yeah, sure), and (get this) take daily injections with a compound normally present in pregnant women. Of course, a woman's body, even if starving, can still produce a healthy baby, because it draws from her store of resources, including body fat. It's also basically a 'set point' approach. Nothing new here, not to mention unnecessarily severe. I think I'll skip this one, folks. Still, I'm sort of glad I read it, if only to confirm for myself what I've heard about this guy."
1,Not An Easy Cure to Follow,"I think this book as his others are very vague in some areas, and he presents such strange things to do that the average person will be frustrated with. Some of the things he asks people to do could only be followed by a fanatic.I should have known from his first book that this would be disappointing."
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You To Know About,"Phase 1 was very useful in that it got me to use probiotics, vitamin E, Omega 6, etc. However, it would have been nice to know that I was going to have to go to a physician daily to get injections for Phase 2. Except for Phase 1, the rest of the book is completely useless to me. I guess the author assumes that everyone has seen him on TV. Not the case, so I had no idea that I would be required to see a physician for daily injections. Because of the remote area I live in, my physician is 47 miles away, and he is not willing to take part in this."
1,"C'mon people....use common sense! There is no ""cure""!","This guy is making ridiculous claims that are completely false in order to sell books to people desperate to lose weight. We ALL wish there was some magic cure, but there is not. Period. The sooner people accept this, and start eating less and exercing more, the sooner crooks like this guy will go out of business."
1,Horrible and unrealistic!!!!,"I was a big fan of Kevin Trudeau until now!! I am soooo disappointed. Whathe said in his last book regarding natural cures made so much sense, so Ijumped at the opportunity to purchase a preview copy of the Weight Loss Cure.What a joke!!! I wasted $29.95 on this piece of garbage that I probablywon't even be able to give away. The library probably won't take it. Theplan talks about HCG injections and a diet plan to follow which is toorigid. My only question is: Where in the heck am I going to get these HCGinjections and how can I convince my doctor to give them to me??!!!! Notonly that I have to get them everyday??!!! Sorry Kevin, for the averageperson, this is too unrealistic, and right now I don't have the money tofly to Germany, find this clinic and go on the program. I am verydisappointed with this book. To all who are reading this: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,blah blah,"I think it is a trap like all the other books he has written, thinking your getting something for your 30 dollars, but when you read it he repeats himself alot. not really saying anything. then he has you go to a website to find the items he's telling you will help and it costs you more. its a vicious cycle. try actually helping people and stop trying to get rich off the desperate."
1,natural cures to weight lose,"the book gives you a diet and what to do, but in the us its hard to find a doctor that will Rx it for you"
1,Weight Loss Cure by Kevin Trudeau,Please do not waste your money on this book. Totally useless and misleading.
1,I just Don't Get It,"I just don't get why people keep making this guy rich. High colonics work, but only when done correctly and with a holistic plan of action. As an editor, I have watched Trudeau's schemes for ""pulling people in,"" and this book was an obvious answer to the popularity of the You Books on diet. Dieting is not that hard! When you understand how the body works and not only the role that food plays, but also water, acidity, digestive balance, etc., it's quite easy. Miracle cures? Look around you. Stay away from ""white"" foods(sugar, white bread,white potatoes,bananas,white flour), make sure your water isn't acidic and that your food combinations are alkalizing. Don't mix fruit with starches, meats, or grains. Avoid red meat. Never mix meat and starches. Stretch, move, breathe and drink healthy water. You just lost 20 pounds in 20 days.Forget the Cures, Find the Cause: Book 2: The Circle"
1,Not what they make it seem!!,"I bought 2 of these books ater seeing the program on TV. After reading my copy I was very dissapointed. It is filled with marketing for other books written by the same author. At the beginning of the book, it appears like a really big secret was going to be revealed, but long before the middle of the book, all hopes dissapear as a looong list of things to buy and do's and don'ts appear. It is no different from the other diets. There are also a lot of contradictions, the auther claims that it is inexpensive but a calculation of the cost of all the items and services required to start this diet way exceed the cost of any diet I have ever done. He also makes recommendations for the supplements needed to cleanse the body, however those too are drugs!! I trully regret buying this book as a gift for someone before reading first. I was too dissapointed in its contents to finish reading it so I don't know whether there is anything useful in those pages."
1,Don't buy this-his methods could kill you!,"This book should NOT be on the market! The methods he suggests will end up killing most people. No wonder he guarantees you can lose 30 pounds in 30 days! I guarantee you can too, just amputate one of your limbs! His advice includes 15 colonics in 30 days, colon cleanse supplements, Coconut & Krill oil...you following along? Plus up to a gallon of water, talk about electrolyte imbalance. For the love of your body, don't buy this book!"
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"This book is a scam. Now if you watch the infomercials Trudeau is onto writing books about making it rich. Guess he knows what the world wants to know, how to be thin and how to be rich! He plays us right into his greedy little hand and feeds us the biggest bunch of BS! Don't waste your money. I read the first few chapters. Nothing made sense at all. Rambling on in verbage to hide his ignorance. I'm sure he is laughing his way to the bank!"
2,This book opened my eyes!,"Kevin Trudeau may be controversial, but the man he gives credit to for finding this cure is an amazing man.I followed this protocol and in 2 months I have lost 45lbs! Amazing! I would recommend this read to all of you who have tried and failed to lose weight! It addresses the REAL reason you are not able to maintain your weight loss."
2,Good straight-forward garage music,"The beats on this CD are a bit commercial but still good. 1,2,6,7,10,11 are my favorites. The mixing is very good and the CD moves ahead with a consistent progression. There is a little tribal and some real mellow garage sound synths. A couple of the drum loops get a little old, but nothing is perfect. If you like garage music, then this is a definite buy."
2,Great,"My name is Larry Howard, and my friends mom wrote this book when we were neighbors in California, back when me and her kids were in middle school, and her book is very touching and well written. Keep on written' Ms. Monique."
1,"Okay, until something better comes along","It is finicky, cheaply made and poorly designed, but beyond that it is a usefull machine when you get it figured out. Mine would overheat until I started using a different AC adapter than the one provided. I never got the 8 hour battery life another reviewer mentioned. I use rechargeable batteries now. I burn 10 hours of music to a couple of cd-rws, occasionally change this mix by reburning the cd, hook it up and leave it on random all day, like a personal ad free radio station. I don't ecommend it for use in the car, not that mine skips, but it is difficult to hit the right buttons, and it usually has to be reset at a red light. I like the idea, but will definately upgrade to a better brand when a worthwhile player comes out at a good price."
1,...,"When I got my player, it had somthing rattling around in it. It turns out it is a plastic nut that came loose. The player only works if it is not being moved, AT ALL!! And it is very choosey about the non-MP3 CDs it plays. I sent many messages to customer sevice, but they never acknowleged my existence. This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought."
1,"Piece ""o"" ...",I bought this ... and it never played a song without skipping. after about 3 days it simply stopped working. I would recommend the Philips player.
2,"Play It Again, Sam","I wear this cd out. I heard the original Abstrakt Workshop at a local hot spot. I could only find AB#2 at local music store. Glad I did. These guys are great. Don't know the lingo about the style of music, but I love this CD."
2,It's a big straw. Awesome.,"I bought these straws to use for thick smoothies, but should I ever make a tiered cake again, I most certainly will be using these for that purpose as well. They are large thick straws at a wonderful price. I will probably be buying them again when I run out."
2,Great,"I thought that the straws would be solid colors, when in fact they were patterned and much more than I had expected. Great product!"
2,Buyer Beware,"These reviews are nice, but read them carefully. This pair of bino's doesn't zoom, but curiously two reviewers praise the zoom anyway.Likewise, another sounds like a commercial for Meade. Although I did read the Wall Street Journal article, and the author's recommendation is why I'm buying a set of these."
1,Disapponting,I was very excited to have bought these bulds. But in less than 3 weeks one of them blew and the warranty said should have lasted a year.
1,"Sorry, but this album is awful","I really like Prince, and was expecting a lot better than this album....There is not one song on this album that I can really get into, his older stuff is so much better. Don't waste your money."
2,Not enough,I only have a few things to say about this album. I saw the concert. It was going and and then some. The album musicology is a rebirth of the old Prince so I am loving it. There is always space for rebirth only problem is it wasn't long enough he needs at least about 4-5 more songs. I give this album 5 stars.
2,Just Saw Prince Last Night!!!,"I just saw Prince in concert last night in Raleigh, NC. In spite of the fact that he has toned down his sexual antics on the stage, he is still one of the most sensual and soulful performers of all time. They were handing out this CD upon entry to the concert so I didn't really expect it to be that good. I have been listening to it today and the more I hear it, the more I like it. It just grooves you! I especially love ""On the Couch"" and ""Call My Name"". These are so reminiscent of the music that my generation made out to, but the lyrics aren't nearly as raw. The base and drums are awesome on many of the tracks. He showcases his guitar playing skills a little more than in the past, but still not enough. I wish he would put out an acoustic album to let his fans hear what we heard in concert. He's still got it!"
1,Doesn't quite live up to the blurb,Bought this to try and learn more about dealing with my home grown meat but got only recipes for odd cuts. The blurbs had mentioned curing meats but the recipes did not address this.
1,Authentic recipes?,"Souffle? Really? I can not imagine that in any appalachian kitchen. The deviled eggs are listed as having olives. Huh? Where did these recipes come from? It appears that the stories are from the Foxfire books, of which I am a great fan, but the actual recipes just don't make any sense."
1,Hope that someone writes a real developer's guide.,"This book is useless for people who need to build real solutions using Developer/2000. Being the only book out there on Developer/2000 2.x, it's sad to say the authors must bear a enormous amount of frustration from developers who need to get beyond the basics and get into the nuts and bolts of Oracle development. Even so, this is not a good beginner book either. Too much time is spent on business processes. While this is an important topic in software development, this book is not the place for it. We need a ""hacker's guide"" to Developer and what we get is the MBA's guide. All other major toolsets from other vendors have an abundance of excellent books about them. Unfortunately, Dev/2K 2.x lags behind in this area too. Being this is the only book on Dev/2K 2.x, I'll continue struggling along with reference manuals."
1,The single worst sexual education book I've ever read.,"I am stunned that this book has received as many positive words as it has by Amazon readers. The book is singularly the worst sexual education book I've ever read. Ms. Hayden's actual instruction is about 2 pages of potentially useful material, the rest is simplistic filler. The ""insight"" you gain from the book can be obtained by actually talking with your female for more than 5 minutes on what she actually prefers. The title sounds grand and glorious; too bad the book doesn't even fulfill 1% of your expectations."
1,Beware the odor problem...,"Structurally the stool is OK for the money. The biggest issue I have is the horrendously toxic smell coming from the foot pad - can't even describe it other than you won't want that smell in your house. And it lingers. I've had the stool outside for 3 weeks now, hoping to air it out, to no avail.Bottom line, I would not buy this stool again."
2,sturdy,"I bought this item to stand on to get in our high sports utility vehicle. I thought I could stand on it (which I can), slide into the driver's seat, and then hold onto the handle and bring it into the car and lay it on the passenger seat. It is a bit awkward to have that handle so high--but it is a sturdy product. I may search for an alternative way to get into the SUV. But the stool itself is very durable and easy to use and I can already see many uses for it throughout our home. A ladder is so unstable and potentially dangerous. This is just the right height for adjusting drapes or curtains, reaching higher shelves in the kitchen and garage, washing indoor windows, etc. etc."
1,Foorstool,"As a nurse am very disappointed in that the handle is not one piece, but contains bolts at the base and mid-handle. In addition, it is wobbly.In addition a nauseating odor emmanated from the top of the footstool. I tried everything to remedy the odor but no luck. I had to return the footstool."
1,Not worth $1,I had to put this together when it arrived. That was not the problem. The problem was that the holes that were pre-drilled didn't line up so I couldn't screw in one of the screws. Then the stool smelled horrible. We would have returned this but I threw out the box. Don't buy it.
2,Well made product,"This is a heavy, well made product that looks like it will give years of service. Assembly is straight forward with one caveat. Five self-locking nuts are provided, four to attach the support handle and one to hold the legs in an X-shape prior to attaching them to the step. At first glance the nuts appear identical, and no differences are mentioned in the instructions. The nut for holding the legs together is different and should only be used on the bolt used for holding the legs together or thread damage will result."
2,Great product and very strong,"I needed this after having surgery, it was very strong and not cheaply made. I stored it away so that when I need it again, I will have it. In comparison, similar items in the medical supply store was over one hundred dollars."
2,Very good product,"This step stool is a Godsend for our family members who have trouble getting into our van. It is very stable.My only complaint is that the handle & the round legs, and the crossing point of the legs underneath, don't quite sit flat against with each other, so that the included screws are just barely long enough. But with a little perserverance, we made it work."
1,Smelly,"As others have said, the instructions were not clear. The rubbery smell was just unbelievable. Either the one I got was returned, or used. Screws are too long. It is functional, but it is currently sitting outside because of the smell. If the smell doesn't go away, I'm returning it."
2,My fav old Palmer-To Have and To Hold,From cover. This is a duet. First story is To have and To Hold: Just who was Cal Forrest? Shy Madeline Blainn's new neighbor was as mysterious a he was mesmerizing. First he'd turned her simple world topsy-turvy and then her heart. Cal's passionate kisses made falling in love easy-but just who was she really falling for. This one is my fav Palmer. It has a dog next door that talkes Madeline.
2,A nice little rock-n-roll CD that actually rocks.,"If you are a fan of Marshall Crenshaw, you'll love listening to this CD of his favorite demo tapes. We like to put this CD on while we are lounging around the pool. It's fun to imagine that Marshall is out in our garage playing and practicing. This music is light-hearted, soul-warming, and just really great rock-n-roll. Phil Wilkerson, Naples, Florida."
1,too big and look cheap,"I am not sure anyone would still use 17"" laptop. this is designed to carry 17"" laptop. I bought it because I thought it would help me carry small laptop and extra stuff, it turned out I could not do it, so I returned it."
1,"Nice, but...",The inside divider literally broke within the first day of use. Overall though it is a good value for the price but severely lacking if you need long term use.
1,Fake ratings!,"I noticed that yhou never published my review that rates the Targus TLE400 Notebook Case as a ""1""Why? You claim your ratings go from 1 to 5, yet you show zero ratings at 1 star. In my opinion this product deserves a low rating. Now I don't trust Amazon in addition to not trusting Targus."
2,Monster Trucks (Pull-Ahead book),This book is a simple text with plenty of information for your young monster truck fan. It is also inexpensive. The only down-side is the out-dated pictures.
1,Very Dated but ok,"This children's book has some very dated (mid 1980s) photography of Monster Trucks. Each photo of a truck has some caption. For example, in one photo, Bigfoot is going through mud and there is a caption that reads ""Some Monster trucks get dirty"". All in all not very good. My son who loves Monster Trucks read it a couple of times. After that, it went straight to the used book store to get something with a bit more meat."
2,Monster Truck Book,"This was bought for a friend of mines Godson who absolutely loves monster trucks. I think it's the new in thing for juniors. Anyhow, he loves flipping through and looking at the pictures. Very good childrens book, Recommended."
1,These should retail for about 6 dollars,"I don't mean to give it such low stars but I think there is confusion on the price. These may be a wholesaler selling large lots.I, think if you are interested in purchasing these, you might want to contact the seller and ask if this is a case not just one little set. I sell Toysmith products in my shop and these are not this expensive individually(meaning one set of 12 cutters as pictured. This would be the price for a unit.) I may have missed if it said it was a bulk unit, but just in case ask them."
2,The Original version,"This is the ""original"". Three Men and a Baby is cute, but this is the BEST! Anyone who likes Three Men and a Baby should watch this and then be the judge."
1,OK FOR THE PRICE,"BODY GLOVE EARGLOVE FITS MY EAR FINE. THE SIZE AND WIEGHT ARE OK. AS FOR THE SERVICE, THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IT LOOSES THE CONNECTION AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF NOT BEING USED. SOMETIMES THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END CAN'T HEAR MY. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS HEARING THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END. IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO KEEP SETTING UP THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MY PHONE AND THE HEADSET, IT WOULDN'T BE THAT BAD."
1,Pretty low end,"I got this headset for free with a T-Mobile V360 activation on amazon. As a free throw in it's been adequate, but don't go out and buy one yourself. Some people I've spoken to with it have heard me well enough, but others said it was a struggle to hear me. Either way I had to talk louder than would be ideal if I hadn't been alone in my apartment or car.I haven't seen any bluetooth headsets with uniformly excellent reviews, so I don't pin all the blame on the BlueVoice, but I do think its quality is on the lower end of what's available. I'm now going to try out a Motorola HS820 to see how that works, thus ending my monthlong experiment with the BlueVoice."
1,Sad Sad Individuals,"I thought I had seen everything but the writer of this book is a pitful man , trying to make a buck off people that others may find important.I guess this book could be about every other religion because the questions asked, are not far from those. HEY, if you are not to tell lies then why do lots of people tell kids Santa Claus is real.That is why kids now do not respect their parents because SANTA CLAUS got me these toys, not my parents......."
1,ULTRA - JUNK!!!!!!,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. I'd rate this product ZERO STARS! if it was possible. As another reported, AA batteries are too big and do NOT FIT into many devices correctly. 3rd or 4th time I used the charger that came with the batteries it significantly overheated and I believe would have caused a fire. I threw the whole mess in the garbage where it belongs. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK OR ASSOCIATED CHARGING DEVICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Great Follow-Up Single!,"I'm Right Here' is the perfect follow-up to Samantha's debut album 'Gotta Tell You.' Her second record, the sensational 'Woman,' was sadly never released, however you can sometimes find promotional copies available for sale on eBay. The b-side 'Sensuality' is also very catchy, and demonstrates Sam's new, more mature sound. The reason I gave this single 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the remix. It's too long, too repetitive, and plain old too boring. You'd think the record label could have come up with something a little better...nevertheless, 'I'm Right Here' is very infectious and well sung, and it's a shame it didn't perform better on the charts and give Ms. Mumba the superstardom she deserves."
2,DJ Krush  - Krush,"DJ Krush's stateside introduction, KRUSH, is chocked full of hip-hop beats and flowing soul. Monday Michiru lends her vocals to the smooth ""Keeping the Motion,"" and Sonya Vallet brings the romantic soul to ""Big City Lover."" But most of the tracks here are instrumentals, tinged through-and-through with jazz. The beats on ""Roll & Tumble"" are tight, and the horns on ""On The Dub-ble"" mellow. ""Into the Water"" brings on some guitar in myriad forms, from jangly to psychedelic riffs, with some swift cutting for good measure. ""Ruff-Neck Jam"" really as rough as you'd think, but it is a full-on jazz jam session. But for me, the top track on here is the multilingual ""Murder of Soul,"" a darker, smoky joint, with hints of mystery in the clouds. A crushing introduction."
1,Not a crockpot cookbook,I searched for vegetarian crockpot cookbooks in the Amazon search bar. This book was fifth on the list and got the best reviews. It didn't occur to me that it might not be a slow cooker cookbook. It is not.
1,Rabbit Cage,I need to amend my previous review of this product due in fact to a weld that connects the wheel to the bottom of the cage that broke. The product was not packaged in a way that prevented it from becoming bent in several places thus making it hard enuff that I literally broke my thumb trying to assemble it and required emergency service on my thumb. I have no intention on paying to ship it back to the seller as I am already out enuff money from purchasing the cage plus hospital expenses and lost time from work. I feel it will be a matter of time before more or all of the welds around the wheels will break.
1,...,This is not a vary good book. There are more informitive books out there. And this is not one of them.
1,Nice but mostly useless,"Buy this book if you want to have another beer book to read or you are an advanced brewer who whats to learn more about chemistry. Don't buy it if you want to get useful informations on how to actually ""do things"". He talks a lot about the general aspects of brewing but without giving you any practical advice or formulas.This book definitely aims to the advanced home brewers who really already know what they are doing and specially the equipment section and recipe section might scare the beginner away."
2,Cute movie,"I wouldn't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, but then again, I have to admit, I did like it a lot. My sister told me to borrow her copy because she thought it was a cute movie. (I had never heard of it.) Not only did I enjoy it, but wanted to add it to my collection. It really is a total ""chick flick"", but if that's what you're in the mood for, it is light and fun. I would recommend it to fellow chick-flick lovers everywhere..."
1,This is okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,The songs wre okay but the song that I did not like the most was Ride the lighting. It didnot even sound close to the origanal.
2,best puppy leash ever!,"my puppy always wanted to sit up front and nothing worked!! we have a dog hammock, he climbed over it. the leash is light to carry and very strong. the latch clips in easily to any seat belt and lets the dog stick his head out the window, but not his whole body! i feel safe with my dog in the back on this leash. i recommend using the middle seat belt in the back seat to attach the leash.bamboo is my new favorite leash and collar company!"
2,Safety first!,"Love these leashes! I have large dogs and the 6'leash keeps them safely in the car, and allows them to move about a bit more than the 3' leash. It's all about safety!!! Wonderful construction and some little surprises...like the zippered compartment."
1,Product size shorter than original,"although the vendor reports that the piece is fit to my car, it is almost 5 cm shorter than the original, which resulted in less space to engine maintenance. I'm pretty upset because I live in Brazil and now I can not return the product. Rubbish purchase."
2,Very useful and discreet.,"Good product. Blends in very well with my other books and is big enough to fit a small gun (.22,.380, small 9, etc.). I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little nook to hide some petty cash, jewelery or a weapon without having to lock it in a safe. That being said, never keep a loaded weapon anywhere that could be accessible by children.Good product. I would purchase another like it."
2,Great Show,Great show!!Great acting by all members of the staff!!Great story line in the complete series!!I look forward to the new season!!
1,Very disappointed,"I was so upset to see this is movie was not made by the My Little Pony brand. The story was scary and the ponies were in less than half the movie. The ponies had different names some not appropriate. Not for young children who love the kind, pleasant and perky ponies we see with the product line."
2,!,"I hold Jay Lee of Houston's KPFT and his repeated playings of ""The French Toast Man"" on the now-defunct 'Wake Up and Smell the Coffee' largely responsible for the dementia of many Houstonians now in their late twenties.This record is too surreal for most people; if you prefer more predictable, less random lyrics, you should pass. But, if you wish to propel yourself into a state of uninhibited lunacy, play this record first thing in the morning, every day, for three weeks. Your life is bound to change."
2,pick up sticks,"My daughter is a social worker and was looking for pick up sticks is stores and could not find them. I found Melissa & Dougs @ Amazon and ordered them for her. She has used them with children that are clients. She told me they were a great toy, much nicer than the plastic ones she remembers as a child."
2,New Low-Country Cooking,"I collect many books on cooking and always enjoy subjects related to Southern fare, especially from the Low Country of South Carolina. This book really hits the mark with some unique as well updated Southern classics. As with most books written by professional chefs, the list of ingredients can sometime be a turnoff to a novice cook. Don't let that stop you! Anyone who enjoys the challenge will relish the opportunity to sample some really spectacular offerings. I can't wait to try the The Carolina Crab Cakes with Dill Lemon Dressing and the Peach Tea Couscous is unusual, but a refreshing touch to this somewhat plain grain. I also purchased the Louis Osteen's Charleston Cuisine. Both books are a wonderful representation of this rich, culinary part of the USA."
1,Do not trust that the title accurately described the content of this book,"I was looking for a book giving me an overview of the history of coffee. The subtitle ""how it transformed our world"" was promising so I got hold of the book. Big mistake. First, the book only deals with the US market. So much for world transformation. Second, the focus is on the first decades of the 20th century. So much for a general history. Third, there is hardly anything about the period 1990-2012. So much for a revised edition published in 2010.Had the content of the book been properly marketed, it would probably deserve three stars. Due the the totally faulty marketing of the book it does not deserve more than one star."
2,Top Quality Device,"I did a lot of research before deciding on this particular trailer. I shopped around to several bike shops, and spent a few hours on the internet. I am very happy with the quality and function of the trailer. It is sturdy and comfortable to tow. The safety features make me confident to take the kids onto the road, and THEY LOVE THE RIDE. I have my two year old following me through breakfast going ""Bike! Bike! Bike!"" Assembly was a breeze. I even pulled it across the grass in the park without too much trouble."
2,Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips,"Do you have the Munchies?Light, non-oily, crispy with a balanced salt content, and perfect taste bud tang, Madhouse Munchies are highly recommended for those with a salt-and-vinegar fondness. This snack is made from select North American potatoes and is quite tasty, the way human nature intended.The only possible downside to this delight is the ingredient LACTOSE, which affects those allergic to milk. Perhaps the company may consider an alternative version of these chips to satisfy a greater population.However, as they say, ""because we cook with healthier oil [non-hydrogenated canola], chips are cholesterol free, 0g trans fat p/s, and has no MSG, preservatives, or artificial colors.Enjoy!"
1,"Early L & H talkie is awkward, but amusing in spots","This was one of Laurel & Hardy's first sound films, and it was also released as a silent. Unfortunately, the film falls somewhere between the two styles, so an upper-berth scene runs too long and goes nowhere. On the plus side, some of the train-station gags are very funny, and the added colorization is a pleasant novelty. Completists will want this, but it isn't Laurel & Hardy at their best."
1,great opening..then falls flat,"for an early talkie this production is quite smooth. the pacing,music,and effects are 1st rate. the story is too thin to sustain interest for 20 minutes.elements of previous laurel @hardy comidies are incorporated into this film but new material would have made this talkie more enjoyable."
2,Sons of Champlin are back and better than ever,"The Sons of Champlin are back, with their best recording ever. Many of their classics from the 60's and 70's appear in this live album, which highlights their originality and musical virtuousity. Although Bill Champlin is perhaps best known for his stint in Chicago, and for writing ""After the Love is Gone"" and ""Turn Your Love Around,"" he seems most at home with this, his original band. Along with Champlin's inspired vocals and command of the Hammond B-3, Terry Haggerty's guitar solos are mindboggling, and like those of no other guitarist. This is an album that fans have been waiting for for 25 years, and it doesn't disappoint."
2,Daughter loves it!,"My 2 year old loves her plush Buzz, Woody & Jesse! they even make it through the washing machine on a delicate cycle! Looking to buy Bullseye next."
1,All 4 horse shoes broken with in 32 days,"Made in china. Cheap material. We used the first two only on the first day. One broke. Took another out, both broke. Now the 4th one broke. Literally have not used these for a full day and they are all broken.Surprised to learn it is complicated to make a quality set of horseshoes. Of course by the time I came online, its too late to return the item."
2,superb,"Lisa Richard has a tremendous voice, beautiful and rich. It's strong and full of emotion, and the songs are both and touching and funny, and she has the range to sing anything and make it special. I truly love listening to both of Lisa's albums, they are both terrific."
2,Modern Day Diva with a Heart of Gold,"I love this album! After seing Lisa Richard in concert, I was really excited to hear that she has a new CD. I love the way she blends guts and vulnerablity into a wonderful variety of tunes - It's like she's singing pure emotion . Gorgeous voice! I'm getting 3 more copies for my showtoonlovin' friends!"
1,not new.,"I thing Tigerdirect sent me a refurbished machine. Bad Packing, etc. I won't buy anything from them, ever. The laptop is great."
2,The Big Book of Painting Nature in Oil,"Really helpful book. Very well organized. Easy to find any subject or any method. Step by step instructions. Excellent pictures, easy to follow instructions."
2,Queens of the zone age,I never saw the Trees but I hope that I might one day. Having bought and liked Mark Lanegans last CD I was still hankering after Vans stratospheric guitar. This really shows what a band the Trees were - you can split them down the middle and each comes up trumps. Great guitars and Ozzy style vocals are to the fore.BTW. I saw Mark play with QOTSA and he was great..
2,Very easy to use,"I wanted a guide to help me identify all the flora on my property after moving here from the Midwest. But I have found it to be a great thing to have along while hiking, too. The historical and cultural tidbits are a very nice touch."
2,At Last!,"I highly recommend this CD to any singer that owns the A Cappella Singer Song Book! I am so happy to have finally found a CD that covers ALL of the songs in this book, even the lesser known! Being a music teacher, I find this CD invaluable! Buy it! Buy it! BUY IT!"
2,entrancing,"My boys, aged 2 and 4 both immediately calm down and get ready for sleep when we read this book. It is written and illustrated to propote a calm, peaceful atmosphere. There is something special about this book that stands out from the typical night time book crowd."
2,Grandfather Twilight,A favorite as my grandchildren visited. Read often before bed. Easy story and beautiful pictures. A must have for every family with young children.
2,Just what I was looking for,"I looked high and low for this book and found it here. It was in stock, arrived quickly and in a padded envelope. The book was in perfect shape and my son (20 months) likes to have Daddy read it to him before bed. Beautiful pictures."
2,"A good sequel to ""Star Trek IV""","Well written story, but drags at times with unnecessary banter and talk. I've read a few of Margaret's stories, but have trouble getting through them due to the extensive content she puts in them.I remember in 1991 when this book was first supposed to hit the book stores. It took forever and that's when I later heard about the problems Margaret was having in her original story. Also, the rumor was that this story was going to contradict the events in ""Star Trek VI"" so it had to be postponed. I don't see why Paramount can't just get together with the authors first and come to a conclusion or agreement.I loved the comment one reader made. I also think they should release an original story version of what it was really going to be about."
2,enjoyable read,"I liked this book and thought that, there should have been follow up stories about theromulan. (another seperate novel)solid read"
2,Best Book for Beginning Jewelry Collectors,This is the best book ever for beginning jewelry collectors. Very informative with loads of information.
2,Great info for the jewelry lover,Great book with lots of insight into evaluating jewelry. I'm a novice and this book is a great place to start learning about how to recognize grades of jewelry. Definitely a reference source to keep. Recommended!
1,I feel cheated,"The ad shows a picture of regular (mamri) brooke bond box which is not available in stores so I ordered it for $14 with shipping. Note that the description does not tell you its 'Orange Pekoe'.What I got was the same orange pekoe which is available in stores for $3 !!!If I wanted the same tea, I would have walked to the nearby store."
2,A must for those visiting Ireland,I purchased the book for my mom for Christmas and she loves it. She is visiting Ireland for the first time later this year.
2,Makes me want to weep...,"Martha Argerich is a goddess. I confess when I hear her play, it makes me want to give up piano because I know that I will never even play even a measure of that Rachmaninoff the way she can. I can't understand how someone who look so vulnerable and so petite has such an unbelievable power coming out of her.I cannot listen to another artist play Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No.3 after hearing hers. Not Horowitz, not Ashkenazy, you name it.It is as finally, the piano has stopped being just an instrument and become a life in its own right.Buy this CD, you will understand why she's a legend."
2,Great saved tracks feature,Up until now I had a Garmin eTrex Legend. What I was mostly missing was the capability to save tracks with all the information (when you save a track it is compressed: less points and the timestamp information is taken away). With the VistaHCx you can automatically save tracks (it will generate one for each day in GPX format) on the micro-sd card. This saved track maintains all the information so I can use it to geotag my photos. I expect it to give me a more accurate altitude reading and have a more sensitive GPS reception but I didn't verify this yet.
2,Good For Geotagging,"I bought this for geotagging with three cameras, two Sony Alpha's and a Panasonic point and shoot.It works well. It is sensitive enough that I can even leave it in my car and still have it work.I wish I could say the same for the Mapsource software that came with it. Mapsource crashes on my Win 7 64 bit machine and, if it does create a .gpx file, the location always shows up in Prophoto Tools 2 as the same place in Kansas. Of course I can't rule out user error, but I found a free application called ""EasyGPS"" that will create the .gpx files I need and add them to images. They also work with the Lightroom geotagging plug-in.The coordinates seem to be accurate to within about 50 meters or so which is good enough for my needs.Garmin eTrex Vista HCx Color High-Sensitivity Mapping Handheld GPS"
1,Can't reach the support...,I called in for a support regarding the Topo map (SD card size difference) but I couldn't get through. Their phone system kept ask me to hold for half an hour! I gave up and going to return the product.
2,Amazing,"I was bought a few months ago, And using in Turkey. i was updated Turkey map. It's very usefull."
1,"Freezes frequently, unreliable... Great reception though!!!","I was completely dissatisfied with this product. I bought it with a mount for my bike and planned on using it for biking and hiking. I returned it after a week. I am very forgiving with a lot of stuff, especially if it's a sophisticated piece of equipment, like this. But this was not up to par at all. I'm now looking at the garmin 60csx. Because at the end of the day, Garmin is still king."
2,Excellent choice,"If you're looking for a gps for outdoors activities(hiking, climbing, biking) and you also want to combine it using it on the road....this is your choice....light weight, water resistance, routable and memory expandable.....I had etrex legend c....I was very happy with it....but this one is better much more."
2,great GPS,Great GPS - good undercover of trees. Poor documentation from Garmin - the owners manual is weak!
2,AWESOME,I just took the SAT II Writing and prepared with this book. The questions in the practice tests had the same EXACT tricks as the questions on the real test. WELL WORTH THE MONEY>!
2,Helped with shopping,A perfect tool to use when shopping. It helps with the fine print on products. It was a great stocking stuffer.
2,Great Classy Product!,"Love it, this is a great product! It was shipped quickly great pricing and easy to hang. I would recommend it to anyone!"
2,Very Usefull,"I don't know if this is real Pow-Wow magick, but I like it and it's very usefull. If you are looking for a book that has some history and usefull spells for healing, protection, and banishing, then this book is good for you.This book is for both Wiccans and Christans, but I don't think I will be using the Psalm magick presented in this book. All in all, this is a great book to have. The only thing that I didn't like was that she included a ""Hunting Deer"" spell. I am a vegeterian and even if I weren't I wouldn't go and kill deer. Although I am glad to hear that her husband hunts deer for food and not a trophy on the wall."
1,Incomplete Directions make this book a bad buy!,"""Photoshop 5 Type Magic"" lacks good direction. I bought this book and worked through many of the tutorials and found many dead ends throughout the examples. I returned this book, along with ""Photoshop 5 Web Magic"". I then purchased ""Adobe: Classroom in a Book"". Maybe I got ahead of myself by starting off with this book, that is my fault. But who's fault is it when the written examples are not complete?"
1,Can't get anything to work,I tried several examples from the book and couldn't get any of them to work! Either the book leaves out critical steps or it's just plain bogus information. What a joke!
1,Atheism at its worst,This book is absolutely terrible. It should be an embarrassment to atheists. It uses the same tired old objections that atheists have been firing at the bible for centuries and many Christian scholars have answered.It's laughable in the naivete of its diatribes. Mindless readers will undoubtedly find it an absolute hoot.
2,Helpful,"The editing of this book is a little choppy, but still a quick read. Susan Miller addresses the roller coaster of emotions involved in any move. She not only identifies the struggles that many women encounter, but probes the heart to examine the root of these struggles. While I could have done without the exhaustive lists throughout the book, the content was truly eye opening and helped to guide me out of my moving funk."
2,Language and Gender,"This is an introductly book for gender issues in the sociolinguistic context. You will find what meanings and problems are hiding behind language use, especially women's language. Aritcles in the book are intresting and easy to read."
1,Drivel,"This book is silly and unobjective.It should be clear from the outset to anyone who reads this that its claims are unfounded, sensationalist, and wrong. The author has neither the academic credentials nor the requisite banking experience to even pretend to provide an objective view of the Fed. I don't know why publishers don't do more fact-checking before sending garbage like this to be printed. Perhaps because they understand, like the author, that even in our modern society, people regularly throw good money at doomsayers and shamans. It's unfortunate that their understanding of money ends there. (Fortunately I picked this up at the library and didn't waste my money.) I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this book. However, I would encourage everyone who reads it to not make it the first or only book they read on the subject. There's too much good material out there to allow this to become a primary resource."
2,The Creature,"Absolutely a terrific read. I don't agree with Griffin's politics but the writing on the Fed is spot on. Examining this smoke and mirrors entity is something every American should do and this book is the start point for making it happen. In all the discussions about the economic disaster and the so called solutions to dealing with it, no one ever discusses how the Fed manipulates the markets and controls the flow of money. No one ever asks the simple question, What is Money? Griffin's book is entertaining, confident and very carefully researched. Read Creature, it will change everything you thought about war, finance and the role of government. It's a 5."
2,No help for my game,"The Sports Check Go Pro Electronic Ball Liner works as advertised--it finds the center of balance and allows you to mark it with a line. Like other reviewers have stated, I lined several balls and then placed them in the machine again to see if they would align on the same line--they did. As far as improving my golf game, I have seen little difference, if any. For that reason, I rated it 4 stars vice 5."
1,"Interesting Plot Line, Poor Execution","This is appareently the first novel by Kevin Grover, a former Army Non-Com. Certainly his experience in the Army would have provided may interesting ideas for a novel, and this must be one of them. Too bad he didn't meet any interesting people in the Army. At least it appears from his characters in Strike Hard that everyone in the Army is dull, listless, and without emotion. Either that or they are all afraid to speak their mind, and are still tied to their mother's apron strings, just like the characters in Strike Hard. This is a book for guys that just want to be friends with women.Despite an interesting plot line, this book was hard to read, and hard to follow. While there were some hints of solid writing, the book was overall pretty boring."
2,"Battle maps enhanced with a ""user friendly"" index","In Battle Maps Of The Civil War, Harold Holmquest has assembled easy-to-use references to 131 battles and engagements of the American civil war as portrayed on 117 maps. These superbly drawn black-and-white maps identify positions and troop movements in a move-by-move presentation and are coordinated with brief text relating significant tactical actions by letters (A, B, C, etc.), along the battle's result. These battle maps are arranged in chronological order and include minor engagements not generally included in most Civil War histories. A ""must"" for all serious Civil War buffs, these informative battle maps are enhanced with a ""user friendly"" index."
1,not enough detail,"I bought this book because it promised to give detailed information on many things, but in fact the chapter on setting up a PPP server was woeful. I couldn't even find out how to setup a getty from here."
2,Thought-provoking premise with plenty of action,"My first Tim Green book got me hooked. This book has a very thought-provoking premise that really makes you think about the idea of what exactly is justice... and what is really right and wrong? You don't find many books that you can root for a serial killer and actually feel good about it. This is a serial killer that hunts down sexual molesters. I could feel for Jack Ruskin as he tried to deal with the molestation of his 15 year old daughter. The scenes where he went to the hospital and tried to get her to react to him were some of the most touching scenes in the book. The characters were very real, and the idea was real, but I do agree that it starts getting out there near the end... but I don't think it takes away from the power of the novel. It's a great book, and I highly recommend it."
1,Not Debbie's best work,"I think the angels are really corny characters in this book, especially their silly meetings. I think Debbie did a great job with the story lines, but the angels just did not click for me."
2,Delightful!,"I enjoyed this light reading....very entertaining, uplifting around the Holiday Season! I would recommend it for anyone who has previously enjoyed Debbie Macomber's novels and those who have yet discovered her. I have now read two more of her ""angel"" books and have giggled about the adventures of Shirley, Goodness and Mercy! Just what we all need in this economy....escapism!"
1,The absolute worst discs I have ever used!!,"When I saw a 50 pk spindle of 16X DVD-R for $29.00 I jumped to buy them. After burning 3 4gb+ ISO images as well as 2 data discs, the problems started.I tried on two different 16X drives, using Nero and DVD-Decry****, on two different PC's. All burns would max out between 11X and 12X. The worst part is that EVERY burnt disc in UNREADABLE in every PC or NB I tried. The disc is either not recognized or, worst, I caused SEVERE CPU UTILIZATION (100% CPU in Explorer.exe when accessing disc)!!! This happened on following Machines: Acer Aspire 3002, IBM thinkpad A20M, Generic Tower with sames DVD drive as used for burn, and Dell GX280. I would love to hear from otere folks, did I simply get a bad batch? Unreal..."
1,Advanced Mechanics of Materials,"While the content of this book seems to be up to par, I am very disppointed with the quality. At something like $135, it should be a bulletproof hardcover book. Instead it is a cheap paperback that started to fall apart at the first use. Now, as I progress through the book, each new page falls out like the last. I am very upset because I like to add my textbooks to a lifelong collection. The publisher should be ashamed of this book. Amazon should do something about it."
2,Works better than Twin Air,"My brother and I have the same bike which is a kx100, he swears by the twin air filters and I decided to purchase this instead. After riding we pulled the filters off, he had dirt inside of his carb and mine was spotless. I sure am glad I purchased this over the twin air. Highly recommended."
1,Too Spiritual,More spiritual than I would want. I am sensitive to spirituality in books since it is so dependant on the individual.
1,introduction of a slash novel,"This is the first part of the long story:if you read this book, and had a good impression, you had better stop reading.The story was a heroic fantasy at the first, and is a slash gay novel now. Book1-10 would not be so bad, so maybe you like them, though reading the succeeded part of the Guin Saga is nothing but wasting your time and money.I have read the story from book 1 to book 88 in Japanese, and I decided to stop reading at last, when i found myself totally disappointed and exhausted, and found the fact that the heroic fantasy GUIN SAGA would never come back.What I have read through 20 years was an amateur's slash gay novel in fact."
2,Blues influenced with a strong folk bent,"DELTA SNAKE BLUES NEWSEditor/Publisher: Al Handa No. 19These guys have created an interesting sound that combines the blues with 60's folk elements, and a delta blues player's sense of rhythm. They intersperse that with pure folk that doesn't have the feel of a minor work, and has a sense of mystery and distance, which at times gives me the feeling that some years from now I'll think some of this will be a classic at least in some sense. One hopes a band like this will be given a chance to see if this is true."
2,exceptional performance let down by average sound quality,"This is great music, done a great disservice by a flat, compressed recording. I'm not sure whether the original master tapes from 1979 were used in this transfer or not - I suspect not - but even if they were, the decision to issue this recording in such uncexeptional form does the long-suffering Blythe no favors.Despite that, this is a highly recommended recording. Seldom does cutting-edge jazz from 1979 still sound so fresh and challenging. I look forward to a remastering of LENOX, perhaps by an enlightened audiophile label such as Mobile Fidelity or JVC XRCD, or perhaps by a reissue on LP."
2,A fun and enlightening read,"It is a fast read. Less then two hundred pages with images. But it is part history, part philosophy and part detective story. Any one interested in Texas History or the writing of history will enjoy this."
2,"Yup, It's GONZO!! and I'm addicted!!","Well, what can I say.... This series deffinatly is not what I expected, however I still have to say that I am really enjoying it!! The stories follows a boy named Hajiki Sanada and his strugles to try to support his family after the passing of his father. Hajiki works as a delivery boy for a local delivery service in a town known simply as Night Town. When he is asked to make a special delivery to an unknown buyer, he stumbles upon a small stone known as a Gad, which is is mysteriously facinated by. Eventually his conection with the Gad increases as he witnesses the Gad evolve into a giant robot known as a Techode. Though the series starts off very slowly, it has alot of promise in terms of a clasic Mecha Story Line. I wouldn' recomend this series to just anybody, however if you are a fan of mecha and do not think that Evangellian is the only good mecha out there (which it's not), than you would probably enjoy this series, so check it out :)"
2,Most emotionally satisfying of 4 Rosenkavalier videos I own,"Despite hard-to-read subtitles, this performance is the best-acted, best-sung, best-staged version of the four I own, including my great favorite, the 1961 film, which I saw as a teenager."
1,Not last long at all,"Bought these bulbs and 5 months later, one of them burns out. Yes, I wear gloves so my hand oil do not mess with the lens. Not recommended."
1,never heard from them,"I tried to return this as it wasn't what the recipient wanted.... I followed the directions for returning this item, which was to e-mail the company but they never returned my e-mail... luckily I only spent about 12 bucks, but I would have liked a response."
2,This album is PHAT!,"I purchased the Sleestack'z album at my local record store because it was creating a buzz in my neighborhood (East New York, Jamiaca Ave.). I was skeptical, being that it basically was an independent release. But I was BLOWN away. The lyrics are TIGHT. The beats are PHAT. There are four very diverse members in the group, each with his own diverse style. There's Nailz, a metaphoric MC with much flow. Then there's Oxx, a Puerto Rican MC who reveals the facts behind what people most percieve as reality. There's Nic the Nobody, an MC whose lyrical flow is on par with the best of the free flowin' greats (Nas, Big Pun, etc.). But what sets him apart from the rest, is the variety of point of views he takes in his rhymes. Finally, there's Dwella, the MC who can take you on a journey around the world (& back) in a single verse. Individually, each one of these MC's can hold their own, but together, they create an extaordinary blend of SLEESTACK'z."
2,"A nice anime, condensed though.","Naturally, there will be differences between a source material and reiterations of it. Black Cat suffers from being condensed into to short of a series. It falls into a weird placement, because two seasons is far too long for it, but it just doesn't seem to have the character depth that the Manga did, but hey- not everything is perfect."
2,great travel case,"I bought this so I can have a case to carry all my Sony's peripherals, when I have to do extensive traveling. I wish I bought something bigger, though this case is already spacious for a camera and the travel charger. Nice material, well made. Good value."
1,nice but theres better,i have the cybershotdsc-p200. i bought this case first but was unsatified with the loose fit of the camera. i then purchased the sony semi-soft case and liked that one much better. no room for the camera to move around or scratch the screen. the downside is nothing but the camera fits in the case so i decided to keep them bot since the other one was only $13.
2,A Great Camera Bag,"After dropping my Sony Cybershot and cracking the LCD screen, I was in search of a better camera bag, and this is it. It is totally black, with only the Sony and Cybershot logo in white letters. I use the shoulder strap, but it also has a belt clip. Note that this belt clip has a snap so you don't have to take your belt off each time you move the bag! It has just enough pockets and no more. Just places for spare memory cards and batteries and maybe a set of car keys. Not really enough room for a cell phone, unless you put it in with the camera in the main compartment. Here's the best part: The main camera compartment zipper has two pulls, so you can have them meet at the top, and leave the wrist strap of the camera hanging out, so you can get your wrist in the strap before you even open the bag to prevent accidental dropping. Believe me, the best chance to drop a camera is when you are removing it from the case!"
2,A Good Buy,The case is really nice and for the price its a good buy. It has ample space for your batteries and memory cards and can be worn on the belt or on the shoulder via the strap.
2,bueno,"es bonito pero me parece que no esta bien diseñado el interior y los bolsillos, ya q no hay espacio para los cables ni el cargador de la bateria, siendo el bolso mas grande que las camaras cybershot"
1,Waste of money.,Was a great disappointment. It would not run on my computer. Would not recommend this to anyone. It was a waste of money.
1,Talks down to the Reader,"While the author's intentions might have been otherwise, this is not a book for anyone with experience in the craft -- her tone is often demeaning as if she's talking to a child."
1,To Light A Sacred Flame: Practical Witchcraft for the Millenium,"I would not recomend this book to anyone, let alone the poor novice that picks up this worthless and sometimes dangerous piece of dribble. Her past books are none too better. I was born into a pagan family, so I did not have the problem of coming out of the ""broom closet"" and neither did my four children. However I am extremely disappointed with Silver's encouragement to hide\lie to the parents of her younger readers.Also the spells in the book are rather vauge and incomplete in most cases and contradicting in others. The section on ""Spirits"" is down right frightening. PLEASE....Do not use these Spirits without some real research.Being from a pagan family I seem to be the dumping ground for her books. I wouldn't even give one of these away because I believe them to be less than worthless.Remember........LET THE BUYER BEWARE.....such truer words have ever been spoken about this piece of repetitive fiction passed off as WICCA."
1,"OK, but not worth the money","I loved Ravenwolf's previous books (Stir a Magick Cauldron and Ride a Silver Broomstick). However, I didn't get anything new out of this book. This book does not encourage the reader to think deeper about the Wiccan/witch/pagan path. Rather, it provides exercises which, while fun and not completely devoid of use, distract one from putting in (HARD) thought and personal effort into the development of one's path. If you want someone to spoonfeed you religion/spirituality, then don't consider paganism.If you want a Ravenwolf book, go with ""To Stir ..."" or ""To Ride ..."" -- these books are much better value, and I enjoy and use my copies (unlike my copy of this book, which I've traded away). Better yet, hold off on the Ravenwolf books until after you've read Marian Green's ""A Witch Alone"" and followed its advice."
1,Depressing and sad,"Although I empathized with the boy in regards to his being bullied due to his perceived sexual orientation, I was disappointed by the ending. It was unnecessarily sad and depressing."
1,If I could give neagtive stars I would.,Just an idiotic presentation any way you look at it. The dialog is practically non-existent and so is the plot. While the general idea of quirky plot may have been fine in the planning stages there is just one problem. 1. The movie is boring and 2. Literally nothing happens. I have heard this rational in movie reviews before but this is the first time I have actually seen it in practice. Quite unintentionally everyone wanders around in search of an exit until the movie finally ends. The one small mercy is at least the film is short.
1,Not that good,"First off let me say I like Nick. I think he is very creative. His role as Terry on Reno 911, his small movie appearances-Blades of Glory, Bench Warmers are hysterical. This is not his best work. The material is very thin with drawn out stories of no point. His first cd is a bit better, and the skit at the end with David Spade is worth the price alone. But, this act doesn't have much of anything. A few chuckles. The audience is obviously been added too, as they roar when it's not appropriate. I know many comics add crowd cheers like sitcoms do, but it's very obvious here, and detracts from what little originality is offered. Too bad, I wanted to like this, it's just not up to par with his other work. Bring back gay robot."
1,Is he copying Dane Cook and Russell Peters?,"I don't know what you call a comedian who copies the style of other comedians. Is that called a hack?Throughout his routine, I felt like there were similar things from Dane Cook and Russell Peters routines.His drinking and drug related humour was not funny and his promotion of his movies was not appreciated.He was not funny in this standup routine."
2,Great Part,"RPM always makes the best parts and these bearing carriers are no exception. These carriers make your truck handle better because it does not cause any turning resistance like the horrible Traxxas part. I love Traxxas but just not their parts. RPM plastics are made of a nylon plastic, so if you hit anything the part will absorb the impact and save your whole truck. These parts are cheap to buy but are amazing quality."
2,This was the best gift i ever received,"I got this as a gift from my sister when my son was 21 days old and it has been so useful. My parents used to watch my son during the day, when we were at work, and My son spent a lot of time in it, so my parents din't always have to be in our bedroom, where we put the crib. my son loved the music, the lights and the toys. we loved the extra large storage space, as i could put all his stuff in there, extra diapers, wipes, blankets, his toys.. pretty much everything. din't use the changing table a lot, but did like it the few times i used it. the fact that we could move it around or rock it was an added bonus. even after my son was about 6-8 months old, we used his play seat to feed him some times, when he din't feel like sitting at the dining table. All in all this was the best gift i ever received"
1,"Flimsy, music do not work","Well, I was expecting to get 5 in one for price of one... had to return the item.... Flimsy construction and music and vibration do not work, moreover, all fabrics is 100 polyester, smells like factory and it is not possible to remove for washing..."
1,saggy bottom,"I bought this item because of all the good reviews, now I wondering if I should trust any of the amazon reviews anymore...It is so obvious that the bassinet bottom was made of 3 pieces, very saggy like a piece of crap... Where baby sleeps has to be hard and flat,that is the only thing important for a bassinet."
1,"Perfect, except for one fatal flaw","I love this bassinet. In fact, we had the same one for our daughter 4 years ago, and it was the one thing we couldn't live without. Great functionality, and we took it everywhere with us. Well, for our son, of course we bought another one. It is a great product, BUT, it has advertising stickers on the carry handle which will not come off. I guess we could use a chemical sticker remover, but who wants chemicals on something for a newborn. So pretty much, it is a great product that looks like garbage because some marketing person decided to put huge, permanent, stickers on it. Amazing how easy it is for them to ruin what was once a great product."
2,The Navy Boys was a great first book,"45 years ago, at age 7, I read ""The Navy Boys with Grant at Vicksburg"" and loved the combination of history and the fact that I could read about it. So, I've a sentimental attachment to the book and still have my well worn copy. The language is archaic and interesting, the history not too far off to be enjoyable, and the details fascinating. Of that genre where young men/boys do heroic things, this book and presumably the series are part of the ""wayback machine"" and can transport one to another time and place. Not only the subject Civil War but also to the author's time and the ideals of that time. I liked it, if I may be allowed a bit of prejudice..."
1,Try another brand,I bought three of these candle based on reviews from other Customers. I love the Diptyque line of candles from John Galliano but the $60.00 cost is prohibitive. My fault....bought them without smelling them first. Not a fan of the scent since it came across as more perfume like then previous reviews had stated. My biggest complaint is that I can't keep the Wickes to lit and have to through them away.
2,Love Jill's work,"This was a hot read, but frustrating as well. The story is captivating to a point and the reader wants more at every turn. I love Jill's work, but I really needed more on this one!"
2,As promised,"This is a great cheap bar and chain. Works well, it's a shame the POS craftsman chainsaw I put it on wasn't as good quality and lasted about 4 cuts after replacing the bar and chain. I can't comment on how well it lasted but it's above OEM quality for crap craftsman chainsaws."
2,Terrific book for kids!,"Just when I thought the only books I could get my 9-year-old son to read were books which had him running into our room in the middle of the night with nightmares...here's comes McGrowl, the Bionic Dog! My son laughed out loud when he read it, then gave it to me and my husband to read. It's fun and I guess you could even say witty, with just enough adventure to keep my son turning pages. It's the kind of book you won't mind reading along with your kid. I can't wait for the next McGrowl book and neither can my son!"
2,"Great, except for intentionally ""retro"" production","The title track which opens the album is awesome. It has quickly risen to become one of my favorite metal tracks. The rest of the album is pretty consistently awesome. This is my first Metal Church album, so apparently there's a different vocalist than in the past. I found the vocalist to fit just fine with the music, perhaps if I had their other stuff I would have a different opinion.The one *big* downer for me on this is the production. I know they were going for a ""retro"" sound here but I didn't dump $10k on a sound system to hear muddy tones. It really agitates me at first but I get used to it after ONLY listening to this album a bit. If you're picky about sound you might not like this album's production. But don't let that get in the way entirely, or you'll miss out on a great metal album!"
1,this makes you feel dumb,I can't get past the girls annoying dumb blonde voice lol not very much of a workout. if you want cardio this isn't it
2,DCC DVD,So excited to finally own this DVD! I own all 3 of DCC's workout DVD's and I would suggest these to anybody!!!!
1,Let Down,"I knew the track list before I bought it, but this disc lacks alot of great music from the weekend. In particular, no Umphrey's Mcgee, no Disco Biscuits, and no Keller Williams Incident! I think most people that buy this disc could do without Del McCoury, The Blind Boys of Alabama, John Butler Trio, or Norah Jones. People are being deprived of great jams, and that just isn't right!"
1,Its very loud,It's very powerful fan..but very loud..would have preferred a quieter one..price and deliver was ok..loud noice is driving me crazy..
2,Great buy,"I brought this for the motor, since mine after 5 years of use everyday, for 2 hours a day finally died. Easy to swap out motors. I would buy from this seller again."
1,I order and still waiting,I order this item since January 1 2008 and still waiting for itit shows that it's in stock but amazon send me an e-mail that it's not still waiting !!!
2,This one works.,"This is not to fault the violin playing, but the piano really sparkles, if such an adjective applies to the f minor. It is fine ensemble playing, and Mr. Prokoviev has the last word. I love the modern Russian composers, and the f minor Sonata has been a favorite since high school. I want this piano player!"
2,Cant go wrong with M&D,Melissa and Doug are always great toys that are quality built. They are the toys that stick around and get passed down from kid-to-kid. Educational and safe toys.
1,The worst battery I never Had,I bought a DSC-P100 and in normal condition the battery is no longer than tree months.Now I have to pay US$ 45.00 for a new one.
1,Terrible and full of New Age pseudoscience crap,"I was hoping for some practical advice on dealing with HSP in my day to day life, not advice on how to be a shut-in. If you've ever read any of the literature on HSP don't waste your time. The only really practical advice is as follows:Meditate and create a relaxing space.Communicate with coworkers, lovers, and neighbors.Eat healthy and exercise regularly, keep a regular schedule if possible.Just about everything else is either common sense or something you will have figured out long before touching this book. Have to deal with a crowed place? Minimize your exposure and wear either earplugs or toss some relaxing music on your ipod. Heavy traffic is stressful? Avoid situations where you have to drive in heavy traffic.There is also a lot of patently bad advice near the end involving bad pseudoscientific crap like homeopathy."
2,Towel Hangers,"Illustration & description were accurate so was able to match existing hooks in bathroom. Installation was quick, simple & easy. Required fasteners included - be sure to use furnished molys for wallboard mounting."
1,Not Water Resistant.,"This watch is supposedly water resistant up to 99 meters...It's not.By day 2, the inside of the watch was already fogging up from the water it would encounter when my 3 year old would wash his hands.And check out the warrenty information before purchasing. It's gonna cost $10 for return shipping/insurance plus the cost of shipping the thing to the manufacturer, so it's cheaper to buy a new one than to use the warrenty."
2,Great Success,"We bought this for our 5 year old Granddaughter and it was a huge success. She loves to play ""pretend"" games and we spent hours tasting various sandwich combinations. Great for a child with an active imagination."
2,Wonderful product,I got this for Xmas for my 1 year old niece. I liked that unlike other play food toys this had no small parts or choking warning. It is very high quality and should last many years.
2,My daughter's a chef now!,"My soon to be 3yr daughter absolutely loves this toy! Just as I hoped, it keeps her very entertained! She makes sandwhiches for the whole family! She also has the wooden cookies and the birthday cake... I highly recommend!"
1,Unbelievably BAD,"There has never EVER been a song remake superior to its original Top 40 hit. This axiom applies to the rehashed DIONNE SINGS DIONNE album. Where once Warwick's lightly delicate voice easily scaled the musical heights Burt Bacharach set for her, she now labors in a husky wheeze to just reach the notes. Her musical range has dropped at least half an octave or more, and she's become shaky. It's sad to hear a formerly great voice go to seed.Stick to Dionne's mid Sixties SCEPTER recordings. You cannot go wrong with the originals.(Thanks to M. Messina for help with this review)"
1,Disappointing,"The beginning started out interesting; then character development just didn't really happen as the focus became more on the romance; and the story line dragged and the dialog became repetitive. I will read it through to the end as I'm already 70% committed. This was not what I expected in light of the ratings it received. I was expecting sympathetic characters in line with Girl w/Dragon Tattoo, Hunger Games, even Twilight and The Hostess. I could not buy into the characters--they are all too nice and unreal--kinda made me want to gag. People really don't think/speak in full dialog as this writer depicts. I would summarize that this is a Reader's Digest read: a Harlequin romance trying to be a detective story. I seriously doubt I would read anything by Dee Henderson again after this flop."
1,Needs a good edit,"I found the first portion of this novel to be a page turner. The set up hooked me and the characters were interesting. Unfortunately, that impression didn't last. I didn't see character development and some of the dialogue was cumbersome. The more I read, the more frequently I discovered misuse of words, missing words, and incorrect capitalization and punctuation. I'm not sure if that's because I was more engaged in the beginning and it didn't matter or if the errors occur more frequently as the story evolves. I downloaded it for free and I'm thankful."
2,Good twists and a quick read!,"I enjoyed this book as a mystery novel. It did some jumping around in the story line, but it all came together. The end was somewhat abrupt, and just not my choice, but overall it was a good book with lots of twists and makes a great whodunnit."
1,Could have been a great novel!!,The story jumps around considerably and then to kill off one of the sisters...that was the best the author could do. It was such an obvious story from start to finish and very unbelieveable.
1,Worst book I've ever read,"There are no words to explain how terrible this book is, I wish there was a way to give a zero-star rating.If you like a lame 'plot', one dimensional characters who all have identical personalities, terrible writing, slow pacing, and to listen to never ending talk about how God loves you, this is the book for you! This is the worst book I have read in my entire life."
1,Get another text,"I had to use this book in my graduate quantum class last fall. It is hard to read, has very few examples, and the problems at the end of the chapters seem to have nothing to do with the content of the chapter. I do not understand how this text can be intended for undergraduates without being overwhelming. Plus I don't think you can do many of the problems without reading the extra optional sections. It could have been a lot more descriptive and concise while explaining things better.On the plus side, it has a decent index and the important equations are boxed so they are easy to spot while reviewing."
2,Thoroughly written workshop manual,"This book is great for both novice and professional mechanics. It provided you lots of details and step by step guide. However, Some guideline to repair the driver electric seat was missing as I was running into trouble of stuck seat back in horizontal positioin and the book didn't give you any information but rather leave it to the Volvo service dept. The owner of 96 model and later will have to invest for the scan tool in order to make a proper diagnosis. Apart from this, it worths every penny."
2,Every girl (~6-14) should see this movie,"This movie is about bullying and has a great message to teach kids (I would state that primarily girls will be receptive to this since it is aimed at that audience). I watched it with my daughter's last night and am planning on watching it with them again (when there aren't friends over), where I can stop it and talk about some of the things that are happening and make sure they fully understand--thus, anything that helps in my teachning of good values, I really appreciate. I believe all the American Girl movies have some value they are trying to drive home and have been useful for training."
2,Deluxe Kitchen,This kitchen is amazing! Definitely worth the money. Putting it together was no problem. All doors open fine just like any toy they need to be broken in. Appliances work awesome. My little one loves the frying and boiling sounds the stove makes and cooks all day. Definitely 5 stars wonderful toy.
2,Great Shoes,Wow these shoes are GREAT! They instantly fit like they were already broke in. VERY comfortable. Highly recommend these shoes.
1,not so great,These Rockports just seemed a lot cheaper and not made near as well as other s we have purchased in the past. Very disappointed in them
1,Did not meet expectations,Rockport Men's Downington OxfordDid not meet the expectations.I thought Rockport shoes will use good quality materials. This one is not.Would not recommend both on quality and comfort as well.Bummer. Wasted 35 bucks on these shoes.
1,Needs help.,"I am in total agreement that Fisher Price Power Wheels is ""sexist"" as put by another reviewer above. These are much too slow, even for the most timid little girl! We took ours back and got our 3-year-old the Kawasaki for boys. It is sooo much better and I wish they would wake up and read these reviews and do something about it. I'd love to spend whatever to get my little girl a quad ride on that lets her keep up with her older brother on his! It's obvious a change should be made after reading all these reviews! Come on Fisher Price!"
2,A Helping Hand with Great Ideas,"This is a terrific place to start when one is planning a garden. The book contains various layouts and ideas for different types of gardens, including garden rooms, planting for privacy, putting in a water garden as well as composting and testing your soil. Although Ms. Lovejoy does include a small section on condo gardening or those with limited space this book is really geared towards those who own their own homes and have some property. This book is loaded with beautiful photos on almost every other page but unfortunately none of the plants are identified within so you will need a companion book to identified the plants, shrubs and trees pictured. That task itself may be very difficult."
2,Fits great,"This was a perfect fit for our last bottle whose threads somehow endedup stripped. If you are thinking of a replacement, just be sure that you havethe correct top opening as there are many dispensers that this would be be toosmall for."
1,Don't try this in public!,"I can only give 1 star for the idea behind the book, but the author should have consulted a wider range of people to get to know the typical ""German slang"". Words like ""abasten"" or ""abflottieren"" really don't exist in the actual German language. If you want to know about German slang, buy a book like ""Kauderwelsch: American Slang, das Andere Englisch"" from Annette Linnemann and Renate Georgi-Walsk, where you can see the German expression for American slang, too. Or just ask the people around you in Germany, they will help you for sure. But don't buy this book, it's really not worth it."
2,Very amusing,"This book is an amusing collection of German slang and is in this way a superior, though different, book from Strutz's ""German Idioms,"" published by Barron's. ""German Slang"" contains some slightly racy, street-wise German that's sure to amuse almost everyone. Some of it, of course, can be spicy. German teachers should look up ""Sprachmufti""--a definition I wound up memorizing--""Er haelt sich fuer Sprachmufti [language expert], die Jugendsprache aber checkt er nicht [doesn't understand]."""
2,God Code Review,"As a seer, I have received information for almost 30 years that we are each an individualization of God and God is actually the sum total of all. I am happy to read in Gregg's work that he has discovered scientific evidence of this fact which I hope will motivate readers to turn within to find their own divinity as opposed to seeking it from an outside source."
2,God is love. Love is all we need.,Written in great detail. Explanations broken down point by point made it easier for anyone to comprehend. Loved it. Enlightening.
2,GREAT READ!,I absolutely LOVED this book! I would highly recommend it to people that are looking to explain God and ancient traditions to our skeptic & contemporary society. Wonderfully written and simply bursting with knowledge!
1,this book is irrevelant,"The arrogance of assuming that God would choose to speak through only one human language must be seen here. To assume one knows the will or make-up of the Creator is blasphemy. We are all part of the One, that point is irrefutable. That the One would choose to speak to us in such archaic ways is silly. It is we who must grow up and realise that the Voice of God speaks clearly to each soul. We have but to be silent enough inside to hear."
2,Mario Sunshine Nintendo GameCube Bundle Review,"Absolutely fabulous system. It has great graphics and the game included was very fun. If you can get this system, do so right away. Or if Mario isn't your thing then they have a great Zelda bundle also. Overall great system."
2,Cool Cool Cool,This Deal is awesome. You save ... buying this bundle. The game is soooooooooooo cool that it is something you can`t put down.Heres what you get.1 Indigo Game Cube1 Memory Card 591 indigo controller.This can`t be a five star because you get memory card 59 instaid of 251. I love this thing a lot. The graphics for Super Mario Sunshine`s graphics are more 3-D than Super Mario 64`s!
1,Buyer Beware,"This book contains all retreads from previous publications. Each American Girl's Christmas story here was written years ago when each ""Girl"" was introduced. The cover is pretty, but very disappointed with the contents as there is absolutely nothing new here at all--not even an intro. Also, beware that many of the ""new"" American Girl books are ""repackages"" of previous publications."
1,Not what I thought!,"Nothing special! All this book contains is the original holiday story from 6 of the American Girls: Samantha's surprise, Kirsten's surprise, etc. They just combined the stories into one volume and added a bonus CD. So I gave it two stars because the CD is the only good part about this since I already owned these stories."
2,GREAT,THIS DVD IS FUN AND ENERGIZING. THE WORKOUT IS GREAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING TO WORKOUT NOW. AND THE RESULTS ARE AWESOME.
2,Feel The Burn!!,"I tried this DVD out and OMG, I felt the burn. I just finished the DVD for the first time and my outer thighs and arms are sore. & I only did the low impact version, I would probably be be hurting more if I did both, the low and high impact. I recommend this for anyone, beginners or intermediate. I don't think you would like it if you are a hard core gym buff, but its perfect for beginners. They don't teach you how to do the exercises so I recommend you watch the workout before you start it. I really enjoyed this workout today. So I totally recommend this DVD for mostly beginners & intermediates."
2,True Flava,"To the guy who said this album is like an enigma album with asian sounds: dude... get outa here. These guys are way more talented than that. They have truly created a ""breakthrough"" album and have gained the respect of every true asian massive fan out there. It is the only one of its kind to have come out of India. Most local talents dont have the courage to go as far as these guys have. That there is scope for improvement is not in question. But I look forward to what these guys will do next. This (their debut album) was in the works for at least the last 10 years."
1,"Oh, dear gods, shoot me now.","This is really horrible fiction. For cheap thrills in fantasy, try Mercedes Lackey or some of the Dugeons and Dragons books.What happens when a pretty bad nonfiction author writes bad fiction? Stay tuned and find out!"
1,Made me cut my lip,"I used this mouth piece for boxing and I was not very happy with it. Every time I would get hit, the top edge of the mouth piece would cut open my upper lip on the inside. I had to actually cut some of the plastic off to make it work. On top of that I had trouble molding the thing to my mouth. I was not impressed with the quality of it for the amount I paid for it. I would look elsewhere next time."
1,Hard to fit,"Got one for myself and one for my wife. Followed the fitting instructions precisely. After two tries, she got hers so that it will work. After a few tries with mine, the gel separated from the rubber and it created very uncomfortable rough spots. Threw it away and ordered a Nano. We'll see how that goes. I can't recommend this one."
2,Pretty good,I play in a rec hockey league and decided to appease my wife by wearing a mouth guard. Took me two tries to get it perfect. Seemed a little small on the first mold. The molar part was way too close together and it kept wanting to pop out of my mouth. But if you gently pull the ends apart a little while its hot (before you bite into it) it remain spread out and should be alright. Mine fits great. There are some edges that could be a little smoother but I hardly notice once I'm out on the ice.
1,Way too big for a woman!,"My mouth is completely torn up from wearing this just 2 times during roller derby practice. . I admit, I am a small 5 1"" woman, but this guard is way too big. I regret making my 12 year old wear one of these for football."
1,Cheaper mouth guards are better,"The gel is very comfortable and easy to fit, but the shell is too big. I've been using cheap mouth guards for over 12 years playing hockey and they are much better."
2,Nice mouthguard,"well... in first place very quick delivery, it arrived really fast..so thats good...I already use the mouthguard and it fits really good...it is confortable and I really fell that my teeth are protected..."
1,Gel Max Schock Doctor,"I could not gets the Gel Max shock doctor to fit even after I boiled it six different times. Every time I tried to get a new fit it wouldn't stay in. If you want a mouthguard that fits don't buy the Shock Doctor Gel Max, it's not woth the $10."
2,A bit small for adult male.,I am a 20 year old average sized male and This mouth guard was a little bit narrow for my mouth. i really had to bend the sides out after heating it up to fit it around my back teeth. The gel in the mouth guard is very effective and forms well to the teeth.
1,Cut up upper lip even on the sidelines,"I did not having trouble fitting this mouthpiece with the boil-and-and bite technique listed, however I did have issues with the hard plastic piece's attachment in the front to the gel. The joint kept rubbing my lip even during insertion and fitting and I've still got a sore there 3 days later. Furthermore it was very difficult to breath and talk. I found it very bulky compared with others (i.e. Under Armour Mouth guard original for contact sports and others), I could bear the gagging and choking but it is more pronounced that with very similar mouth guards designed for impact sports. bottom line: I wasted a bunch of money on this poorly-fitting, expensive, and difficult to wear device, as for it's protection during play? I have no idea. But, I can tell you that it's so uncomfortable to wear that the chances of someone wearing it are lower and therefore even if it did preform it's job well it's almost pointless.If I were you I would pick a different product."
1,"cheap, uncomfortable, not well moldable","Just got this and tried it, following the instructions exactly. Took a couple of tries to get it to the point where it's barely wearable. It's way too balky and terribly uncomfortable. oh and forget about trying to breathe while you have it in your mouth...especially when you're doing cardio and need more oxygen.my advice is to stay away from this one...even though it's little cheaper than some of the others. saving a couple of dollars was definitely not worth it. at least for me."
1,This printer never even turned on. It sucked.,Do not buy. It was bad. I was so happy to buy a printer for my parents and hook it up but it would not even turn on. I ended up ordering a completely different printer. I don't know if it was damaged due to shipping or what but I was very disappointed.
2,Couldn't sleep until I finished it.,"I ""couldn't sleep until I finished it"" has been the typical response from TIES OF LOVE of my friends. Like me, many say they like the historic touches of day to day life."
2,I am hooked!,"I am hooked on this author. I have bought nearly all of her books o9n Kindle! Joanna Brady, J.P. Beaumont and now the sheriff series. Amazing."
1,Not dishwasher safe,"I had this on my wish list because it was the size that I needed plus it was pink - I love everything pink. My husband bought it for me as one of my anniversary gifts, but when I opened it I found out that you can't put it in the dishwasher. Who makes pots and pans that can't be put in the dishwasher? It's beautiful and I'd love to keep it, but there's no way I would want a stockpot that has to be washed by hand. Most cooks would want to know that up front before they purchase it. The description of the item does not mention this detail, and I think it should, therefore I gave it 2 stars. I will be returning this item."
1,Unusable,"I bought 2 CDs of The Bus Boys and returned one for a refund. After the seconmd arrived, it also was useless. Very poor quality. It deserves a O for a rating."
2,Great Item!,I love how it feels. Better grip. It doesn't protect the screen but its better than having it bare. Goes in perfectly and stays there perfectly. I love the color. You can't even tell what color you zune is. Great product.
